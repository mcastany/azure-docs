#Injecting Custom Data into an Azure Virtual Machine 

Injecting a script or other data into an Azure Virtual Machine when it is being provisioned is a very common scenario, regardless whether the operating system is Microsoft Windows or a Linux distribution. This topic describes how to:

- Inject data into an Azure Virtual Machine when it is being provisioned

- Retrieve it for both Windows and Linux, and 

- Use special tools available on some systems to detect and handle custom data automatically.

> [WACOM.NOTE] This topic expands upon [this Azure blog post](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/04/21/custom-data-and-cloud-init-on-windows-azure/) about this feature, and will be kept up-to-date as more functionality appears.

## <a id="injectingCustomData"></a>Injecting the Custom Data into your Azure Virtual Machine

This feature is currently supported only in the [Microsoft Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-tools-xplat). Although you may use any of the options for the `azure vm create` command, the following approach demonstates one very basic approach. 

```
    PASSWORD='AcceptablePassword -- more than 8 chars, a cap, a num, a special'
    VMNAME=mycustomdataubuntu
    USERNAME=username
    VMIMAGE= An image chosen from among those listed by azure vm image list
    azure vm create $VMNAME $VMIMAGE $USERNAME $PASSWORD --location "West US" --json -d ./custom-data.txt -e 22
```


## <a id="usingCustomData"></a>Using Custom Data in the Virtual Machine
 
+ If your Azure Virtual Machine is a Windows Virtual Machine, then the custom data file is saved to `%SYSTEMDRIVE%\AzureData\CustomData.bin` and although it was base64-encoded to transfer from the local computer to the new Virtual Machine, it is automatically decoded and can be opened or used immediately. 

   > [WACOM.NOTE] If the file exists, it is overwritten. The security on directory is set to **System:Full Control** and **Administrators:Full Control**.

+ If your Azure Virtual Machine is a Linux Virtual Machine, then the custom data file will be located in the following two places, but the data will be base64-encoded, so you will need to decode the data first.

    + At `/var/lib/waagent/ovf-env.xml`
    + At `/var/lib/waagent/CustomData` 

<!--Every topic should have next steps and links to the next logical set of content to keep the customer engaged-->
## <a id="nextsteps"></a>Next steps: Using cloud-init

If your Azure Virtual Machine is an Ubuntu image, then you can use cloud-init to launch a script to use your custom data automatically (or, if your custom data file is a script, execute it). For further information, see the [cloud-init documentation for Ubuntu](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/CloudInit).
