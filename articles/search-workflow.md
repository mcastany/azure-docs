# Azure Search: development workflow

[WACOM.INCLUDE [This article uses the Azure Preview portal](../includes/preview-portal-note.md)]

This article provides a roadmap and a few best practices for creating and maintaining the search service and its indexes. 

We assume that you have already provisioned the service. If you havenâ€™t done that yet, see [Configure search in the Azure Preview portal]() to get started.

+ [Step 2: Add documents](#sub-2)
+ [Step 3: Query an index](#sub-3)
+ [Step 4: Update or delete indexes and documents](#sub-4)
+ [Storage design considerations](#sub-5)


<h2 id="sub-1">Step 1: Create the index</h2>

Queries (at least non-system queries) target a search index that contains search data and attributes. In this step, you define the index schema in JSON format and execute an HTTPS PUT request to have this index created in the service. 

Indexes are typically coded in your local development environment. There are no built-in tools or editors for index definition. For more information about creating the index, see [Create Index (Azure Search API)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn798941.aspx) on MSDN.

<h2 id="sub-2">Step 2: Add documents</h2>

Once the search index is created, you can add documents to the index by POSTing them in JSON format. Each document must have a unique key and a collection of fields containing searchable and non-searchable data. Document data is represented as a set of key/value pairs.

We recommend adding documents in batches to improve throughput. You can batch up to 10,000 documents, assuming an average document size of about 1-2KB.

There is an overall status code for the POST request. Status codes are either HTTP 200 (Success) or HTTP 207 (Multi-Status) if there is combination of successful and failed documents. In addition to the status code for the POST request, Azure Search maintains a status field for each document. Given a batch upload, you need a way to get per-document status that indicates whether the insert succeeded or failed for each document. The status field provides that information. It will be set to false if the document failed to load.

Under heavy load, it's not uncommon to have some upload failures. Should this occur, the overall status code is 207, indicating a partial success, and the documents that failed indexing will have the 'status' property set to false.

> [WACOM.NOTE] When the service receives documents, they are queued up for indexing and may not be immediately included in search results. When not under a heavy load, documents are typically indexed within a few seconds.


<h2 id="sub-3">Step 3: Query an index</h2>

Once documents have been indexed, you can execute search queries. You can query one index at a time, using either OData or a simple query syntax:

+	[OData expression syntax for Azure Search](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn798921.aspx)
+	[Simple query syntax in Azure Search](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn798920.aspx)

<h2 id="sub-4">Step 4: Update or delete indexes and documents</h2>

Optionally, you can make schema changes to the search index, update or delete documents from within the index, and delete indexes.

When updating an index, you can combine multiple actions (insert, merge, delete) into the same batch, eliminating the need for multiple round trips. Currently Azure Search does not support partial updates (HTTP PATCH), so if you need to update an index, you must resend the index definition.

<h2 id="sub-5">Storage design considerations</h2>

Many search applications use several storage format for different application needs. The internal storage that comes with Azure Search must be used to store indexes and documents. Text analysis is dependent on having all searchable fields and associated attributes readily available.

Not all fields in a document will be searchable. For example, if your application is an online catalog for music or videos, we recommend storing binary files in BLOB or some other storage. The binary files themselves are not searchable, hence there is no need to persist them in Azure Search storage. You should store images, videos, audio files in other services or locations, with a field in the document storing the URL to the file location.
