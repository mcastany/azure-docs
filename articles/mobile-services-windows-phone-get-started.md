<p>This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Windows Phone 8 app using Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple <em>To do list</em> app that stores app data in the new mobile service.</p>
<p>If you prefer to watch a video, the clip to the right follows the same steps as this tutorial. In the video, Nick Harris provides an introduction to Mobile Services and walks through creating your first mobile service and connecting to it from a Windows Store app.</p>

In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses JavaScript for server-side business logic. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio, see the [.NET backend version] of this topic.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

>[WACOM.NOTE]To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A30A4DDE2&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2FFen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-windows-phone-get-started%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>. To create a new Windows Phone 8.1 app, you must have Visual Studio 2013 Update 2, or a later version.

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new Windows Phone 8 app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows Phone 8** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Phone 8 app**.

   	![][6]

   	This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Phone app connected to your mobile service.

  	![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone] on your local computer.

	>[WACOM.NOTE]To create a Windows Phone 8.1 app, you must have Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 installed.

4. Click **Create TodoItem table** to create a table to store app data.

5. Under **Download and run app**, click **Download**. 

  	This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Run your Windows Phone app

The final stage of this tutorial is to build and run your new app.

1. Browse to the location where you saved the compressed project files, expand the files on your computer, and open the solution file in Visual Studio.

2. (Optional) If you are creating a Windows Phone 8.1 app, right-click the project in Solution Explorer, click **Properties**, set **Target Windows Phone OS Version** to **Windows Phone 8.1**, then click **Yes** to upgrade the project.

3. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.

4. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _Complete the tutorial_ and then click **Save**.

   	![][10]

   	This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile service, and the data is displayed in the list.

	>[WACOM.NOTE]You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

5. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItems** table.

   	![][11]

   	This lets you browse the data inserted by the app into the table.
