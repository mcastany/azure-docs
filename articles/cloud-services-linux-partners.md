##Ubuntu Juju

[![Juju](./media/cloud-services-linux-partners/juju.png)](https://juju.ubuntu.com/)

[http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/azure](http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/azure)

After recognizing cloud computing was the future and analyzing what cloud adoption would mean to both IT organizations and developers, we've developed Juju, a game-changing service orchestration toolset, that enables the knowledge connected with an application—dependencies, relations and platform configuration—to be encapsulated in a charm.

A Juju charm is a collection of pre-written instructions that deploys a cloud service. More than 50 are already available, for services including Hadoop, PostgreSQL and Drupal. And because anyone can submit one, the selection is growing all the time.

Juju is tightly coupled with provisioning, however independent of the underlying infrastructure layer. The base platform can be installed on a public cloud, private cloud, or hardware, ready for the services to be deployed, controlled, and scaled on top with Juju.
