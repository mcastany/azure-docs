This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Windows Phone 8 app. 
In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Microsoft Push Notification Service (MPNS) to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

>[WACOM.NOTE]This topic supports <em>existing</em> mobile services that have <em>not yet been upgraded</em> to use Notification Hubs integration. When you create a <em>new</em> mobile service, this integrated functionality is automatically enabled. For new mobile services, see [Get started with push notifications](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-phone-get-started-push/).
>
>Mobile Services integrates with Azure Notification Hubs to support additional push notification functionality, such as templates, multiple platforms, and improved scale. <em>You should upgrade your existing mobile services to use Notification Hubs when possible</em>. Once you have upgraded, see this version of [Get started with push notifications](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-phone-get-started-push/).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Create the Registrations table]
2. [Add push notifications to the app]
3. [Update scripts to send push notifications]
4. [Insert data to receive notifications]

This tutorial requires [Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows Phone], or a later version.

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

   >[WACOM.NOTE]When you send more than 500 messages per user each day, you must instead use Notification Hubs. For more information, see <a href="/en-us/manage/services/notification-hubs/getting-started-windows-dotnet/">Get started with Notification Hubs</a>.

## <a name="create-table"></a>Create a new table

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-push-table](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-push-table.md)]

<h2><a name="add-push"></a><span class="short-header">Add push notifications</span>Add push notifications to your app</h2>
		
1. In Visual Studio, open the project file MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following code that creates a new **Registrations** class:

	    public class Registrations
	    {
	        public string Id { get; set; }
	
	        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "handle")]
	        public string Handle { get; set; }
	    }
	
	The Handle property is used to store the channel URI.

2. Open the file App.xaml.cs and add the following using statement:

        using Microsoft.Phone.Notification;

3. Add the following to App.xaml.cs:
	
        public static HttpNotificationChannel CurrentChannel { get; private set; }

		private async void AcquirePushChannel()
        {
            CurrentChannel = HttpNotificationChannel.Find("MyPushChannel");

            if (CurrentChannel == null)
            {
                CurrentChannel = new HttpNotificationChannel("MyPushChannel");
                CurrentChannel.Open();
                CurrentChannel.BindToShellTile();
            }
                  
	       IMobileServiceTable<Registrations> registrationsTable = App.MobileService.GetTable<Registrations>();
	       var registration = new Registrations { Handle = CurrentChannel.ChannelUri.AbsoluteUri };
	       await registrationsTable.InsertAsync(registration);
        }

   	This code acquires and stores a channel for a push notification subscription and binds it to the app's default tile.

	<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
		<p>In this this tutorial, the mobile service sends a flip Tile notification to the device. When you send a toast notification, you must instead call the <strong>BindToShellToast</strong> method on the channel. To support both toast and tile notifications, call both <strong>BindToShellTile</strong> and  <strong>BindToShellToast</strong> </p>
	</div>
    
4. At the top of the **Application_Launching** event handler in App.xaml.cs, add the following call to the new **AcquirePushChannel** method:

        AcquirePushChannel();

   	This guarantees that the **CurrentChannel** property is initialized each time the application is launched.


5.	In the Solution Explorer, expand **Properties**, open the WMAppManifest.xml file, click the **Capabilities** tab and make sure that the **ID___CAP___PUSH_NOTIFICATION** capability is checked.

   	![][1]

   	This makes sure that your app can receive push notifications.

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the insert script</span>Update the registered insert scripts in the Management Portal</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-update-registrations-script](../includes/mobile-services-update-registrations-script.md)]

4. Click **TodoItem**, click **Script** and select **Insert**. 

   	![][10]

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

	    function insert(item, user, request) {
    	    request.execute({
        	    success: function() {
            	    request.respond();
            	    sendNotifications();
        	    }
    	    });

	        function sendNotifications() {
        	    var registrationsTable = tables.getTable('Registrations');
        	    registrationsTable.read({
            	    success: function(registrations) {
                	    registrations.forEach(function(registration) {
                    	    push.mpns.sendFlipTile(registration.handle, {
                        	    title: item.text
                    	    }, {
                        	    success: function(pushResponse) {
                            	    console.log("Sent push:", pushResponse);
                        	    }
                    	    });
                	    });
            	    }
        	    });
    	    }
	    }

    This insert script sends a push notification (with the text of the inserted item) to all channels stored in the **Registrations** table.

<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test push notifications in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, select **Deploy Solution** on the **Build**  menu.

2. In the emulator, swipe to the left to reveal the list of installed apps and find the new **TodoList** app.

3. Tap and hold on the app icon, and then select **pin to start** from the context menu.

  	![][2]

  	This pins a tile named **TodoList** to the start menu.

4. Tap the tile named **TodoList** to launch the app. 

  	![][3]

5. In the app, enter the text "hello push" in the textbox, and then click **Save**.

   	![][4]

  	This sends an insert request to the mobile service to store the added item.

6. Press the **Start** button to return to the start menu. 

  	![][5]

  	Notice that the application received the push notification and that the title of the tile is now **hello push**.
