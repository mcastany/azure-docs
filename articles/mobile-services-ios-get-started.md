In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses JavaScript for server-side business logic. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio, see the [.NET backend version] of this topic.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

Completing this tutorial requires XCode 4.5 and iOS 5.0 or later versions. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile services that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-ios%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.</p></div>

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new iOS app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **iOS** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new iOS app**.

   	![][6]

   	This displays the three easy steps to create an iOS app connected to your mobile service.

  	![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Xcode] v4.4 or a later version.

4. Click **Create TodoItems table** to create a table to store app data.

5. Under **Download and run your app**, click **Download**. 

  	This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service, along with the Mobile Services iOS SDK. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

## Run your new iOS app
