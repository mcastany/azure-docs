##<a name="intro"></a>Introduction

In a .NET backend mobile service, you can define custom business logic as JavaScript code that's stored and executed on the server. This server script code is assigned to one of the following server functions:

+ [Insert, read, update, or delete operations on a given table][Table operations].
+ [Scheduled jobs][Job Scheduler].
+ [HTTP methods defined in a custom API][Custom API anchor]. 

The signature of the main function in the server script depends on the context of where the script is used. You can also define common script code as nodes.js modules that are shared across scripts. For more information, see [Source control and shared code][Source control, shared code, and helper functions].

For descriptions of individual server script objects and functions, see [Mobile Services server script reference].
