# Simple recommendation engine using Apache Mahout

Apache Mahoutâ„¢ is a machine learning library built for use in scalable machine learning applications. Recommender engines such as Mahout are one of the most popular types of machine learning applications in use today and have many obvious marketing applications.

Apache Mahout provides a built-in implementation for Item-based Collaborative Filtering. This approach is widely used to conduct recommendation data mining. Item-based collaborative filtering was developed by Amazon.com. The idea here is that data on user preferences that exhibit correlations between item preferences can be use to infer the tastes of future users from a similar group.

In this tutorial you use the  [Million Song Dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile) site and download the [dataset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip) to create song recommendations for users based on their past listening habits.



You will learn:

* How to use recommendation engines

This tutorial is composed of the following segments:

1. [Setup and configuration](#setup)
2. [Examining and formatting the data](#segment1)
3. [Installing Mahout](#Segment2)
4. [Running the Mahout job](#segment2)

## <a name="setup"></a>Setup and configuration 

This tutorial assumes that you have gotten setup with Azure and the HDinsight preview and that you have created an HDInsight cluster on which you can run a sample. If you have not done this already, consult the [Get Started with the Azure HDInsight](/en-us/manage/services/hdinsight/get-started-hdinsight/) tutorial for instructions on how to satisfy these prerequisites.

## <a name="segment1"></a>Examining and formatting the data 

This example deals with the way in which users express a preference for certain songs. The assumption is that the number of times a user listens to a song provides a measure of that user's preference for that song. Patterns detected in the preference data can be used to predict future user preferences based on some of their expressed musical preferences. You can view a sample of this dataset in the **Description** section of the [Echo Nest Taste Profile Subset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile) web page:

![The Echo Nest Taste Profile Subset][echo-nest]

###Sample data from the Million Song Dataset

To use this dataset with Mahout you need to do two things:

1.	Convert the IDs of both the songs and users to integer values.
2.	Save the new values with their rankings to a comma-separated file.

If you do not have Visual Studio 2010 installed, please skip this step and go to Running Mahout Job Section to get a pre-generated version.

Start by launching Visual Studio 2010. In Visual Studio, select **File -> New -> Project**. In the **Installed Templates** pane, inside the **Visual C#** node, select the **Window** category, and then select **Console Application** from the list. Name the project "ConvertToMahoutInput" and click the **OK** button.

![creating a console application][create-console-app]

###Creating a console application

1. Once the application is created, open the **Program.cs** file and add the following static members to the **Program** class:


		const char tab = '\u0009';
		static Dictionary<string, int> usersMapping = new Dictionary<string, int>();
		static Dictionary<string, int> songMapping = new Dictionary<string, int>();	


2. Next, add the `using System.IO;` statment and fill the **Main** method with the following code:

		var inputStream = File.Open(args[0], FileMode.Open);
		var reader = new StreamReader(inputStream);

		var outStream = File.Open("mInput.txt", FileMode.OpenOrCreate);
		var writer = new StreamWriter(outStream);

		var i = 1;

		var line = reader.ReadLine();
		while (!string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace(line))
		{
    		i++;
    		if (i > 5000)
			break;
    		var outLine = line.Split(tab);

    		int user = GetUser(outLine[0]);
    		int song = GetSong(outLine[1]);

    		writer.Write(user);
	    	writer.Write(',');
	    	writer.Write(song);
	   	 	writer.Write(',');
	   	 	writer.WriteLine(outLine[2]);

    		line = reader.ReadLine();
		}

		Console.WriteLine("saved {0} lines to {1}", i, args[0]);
	
		reader.Close();
		writer.Close();
	
		SaveMapping(usersMapping, "users.csv");
		SaveMapping(songMapping, "mInput.csv");
	
		Console.WriteLine("Mapping saved");
		Console.ReadKey();


3. Now create the **GetUser** and **GetSong** functions, which convert the ids to integers:

		static int GetUser(string user)
		{
    		if (!usersMapping.ContainsKey(user))
        		usersMapping.Add(user, usersMapping.Count + 1);

    		return usersMapping[user];
		}

		static int GetSong(string song)
		{
    		if (!songMapping.ContainsKey(song))
        		songMapping.Add(song, songMapping.Count + 1);

    		return songMapping[song];
		}

4. Finally, create the utility that implements the SaveMapping method that saves bot mapping dictionaries to .csv files.

		static void SaveMapping(Dictionary<string, int> mapping, string fileName)
		{
    		var stream = File.Open(fileName, FileMode.Create);
    		var writer = new StreamWriter(stream);

    		foreach (var key in mapping.Keys)
    		{
        		writer.Write(key);
        		writer.Write(',');
        		writer.WriteLine(mapping[key]);
    		}

    		writer.Close();
		}

5. Download the sample data from [this link](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/sites/default/files/challenge/train_triplets.txt.zip). Once downloaded, open **train\_triplets.txt.zip** and extract **train\_triplets.txt**.

	When running the utility, include a command line argument with the location of **train\_triplets.txt**. To do so, right-click the **ConvertToMahoutInput** project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Properties**. On the project properties page, select the **Debug** tab on the left side, and add the path of &lt;localpath&gt;train\_triplets.txt to the **Command line arguments** text box:

	![setting command line arguments][set-cmd-line-args]

###Setting the Command line argument

- Press **F5** to run the program. Once complete, open the **bin\Debug** folder from the location to which the project was saved, and view the utility's output.  You should find users.txt and mInput.txt

## <a name="segment2"></a>Installing Mahout 

- Open the HDInsight cluster portal, and click the **Remote Desktop** icon.

	![The Manage Cluster Icon][mng-cluster-icon]

###The Remote Desktop icon

HDInsight does not include Mahout by default. But since it is part of the Hadoop eco-system, it can be download from the  [Mahout](http://mahout.apache.org/) website. The most recent version is at 0.7, but this set of instruction is compatible for either version 0.5 or 0.7.

1. First, download [Mahout version 0.7](http://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/mahout/) onto your local machine.

2. Then Copy it onto the cluster by selecting the local zip file and press control-v to copy, then paste it in to your Hadoop Cluster.

	![Uploading Mahout][uploading-mahout]

###Copying Mahout to the Headnode

1. Finally right click on the zip file after the copying process is done, extract the Mahout distribution into C:\apps\dist.  You now have mahout installed in C:\apps\dist\mahout-distriution-0.7.  

2. Rename the folder to c:\apps\dist\mahout-0.7 for simplicity.  

### <a name="segment3"></a>Running the Mahout job 

1. Copy the **mInput.txt** file from the **bin\Debug** folder to **c:\\** on the remote cluster. Once the file is copied, extract it. As mentioned in the previous section, copying a file onto a remote RDP session is by pressing control-C on your local machine after selecting the files, then control-v onto the RDP session Window. 

2. Create a file that contains the ID of the user for whom you will be generating recommendations. To do so, simply create a text file called **users.txt** in **c:\\**, containing the id of a single user.

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>You can generate recommendations for more users by putting their IDs on separate lines. If you have issues generating mInput.txt and users.txt you may download an pre-generated version at this github <a href="https://github.com/wenming/BigDataSamples/tree/master/mahout">repository</a>. 

It is the most convenient to download everything as one <a href="https://github.com/wenming/BigDataSamples/archive/master.zip">zip file</a>. Find users.txt and mInput.txt and copy them to the remote cluster in folder c:\</p> 
</div>

At this point you should open a Hadoop terminal window and navitate to the folder that contains users.txt and mInput.txt.  

![Mahout command window][mahout-cmd-window]

###Hadoop Command Window

1. Next, copy both **mInput.txt** and **users.txt** to HDFS. To do so, open the **Hadoop Command Shell** and run the following commands:

		hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal c:\mInput.txt input\mInput.txt
		hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal c:\users.txt input\users.txt

2. Verify the files have been copied to HDFS:

		hadoop fs -ls input/

	This should show:  

		Found 2 items
		-rwxrwxrwx   1 writer supergroup      53322 2013-03-08 20:32 /user/writer/input/mInput.txt
		-rwxrwxrwx   1 writer supergroup        353 2013-03-08 20:33 /user/writer/input/users.txt

3. Now we can run the Mahout job using the following command:

		c:\apps\dist\mahout-0.7\bin>hadoop jar c:\Apps\dist\mahout-0.7\mahout-core-0.7-job.jar org.apache.mahout.cf.taste.hadoop.item.RecommenderJob -s SIMILARITY_COOCCURRENCE --input=input/mInput.txt --output=output --usersFile=input/users.txt

	There are many other "distance" functions that the recommendation engine could use to compare the feature fector for different users, you may experiment and change the Similarity class to SIMILARITY\_COOCCURRENCE, SIMILARITY\_LOGLIKELIHOOD, SIMILARITY\_TANIMOTO\_COEFFICIENT, SIMILARITY\_CITY\_BLOCK, SIMILARITY\_COSINE, SIMILARITY\_PEARSON\_CORRELATION, SIMILARITY\_EUCLIDEAN\_DISTANCE.  For the purpose of this tutorial we will not go into the detailed data science aspect of Mahout. 

4. The Mahout job should run for several minutes, after which an output file will be created. Run the following command to create a local copy of the output file:

		hadoop fs -copyToLocal output/part-r-00000 c:\output.txt

5. Open the **output.txt** file from the **c:\\** root folder and inspect its contents. The structure of the file is as follows:

		user	[song:rating,song:rating, ...]

6. If you would like to use other parts of Mahout on your cluster, you should save a copy of Mahout.cmd in the Mahout distribution's bin directory.  


## <a name="summary"></a>Summary 

Recommender engines provide important functionality for many modern social networking sites, online shopping, streaming media, and other internet sites. Mahout provides an out-of-the-box recommendation engine that is easy to use, contains many useful features, and is scalable on Hadoop.
