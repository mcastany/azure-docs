This topic shows how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Android app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

>[WACOM.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates Mobile Services integration with Notification Hubs, which is how you send push notifications from your mobile service. If you are using an older mobile service that is using legacy push and has not yet been upgraded to use Notification Hubs, <em>we recommend that you upgrade</em> as part of this tutorial. If you choose not to upgrade now, you should follow this version of the tutorial: [Get started with push notifications (legacy)](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Enable Google Cloud Messaging](#register)
2. [Configure Mobile Services](#configure)
3. [Add push notifications to your app](#add-push)
4. [Update scripts to send push notifications](#update-scripts)
5. [Insert data to receive notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service.  

##<a id="register"></a>Enable Google Cloud Messaging

>[WACOM.NOTE]To complete this procedure, you must have a Google account that has a verified email address. To create a new Google account, go to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268302" target="_blank">accounts.google.com</a>.

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Enable GCM](../includes/mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging.md)]

Next, you will use this API key value to enable Mobile Services to authenticate with GCM and send push notifications on behalf of your app.

##<a id="configure"></a>Configure Mobile Services to send push requests

1. Log on to the [Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-selection.png)

2. Click the **Push** tab, enter the **API Key** value obtained from GCM in the previous procedure, then click **Save**.

	>[WACOM.NOTE]When you are completing this tutorial using an older mobile service, you might see a link at the bottom of the **Push** tab that says **Enable Enhanced Push**. Click this now to upgrade your mobile service to integrate with Notification Hubs. This change cannot be reverted. For details on how to enable enhanced push notifications in a production mobile service, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391951">this guidance</a>.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-push-tab-android.png)

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Important</b>
	<p>When you set your GCM credentials for enhanced push notifications in the Push tab in the portal, they are shared with Notification Hubs to configure the notification hub with your app.</p>
    </div>


Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with GCM and Notification Hubs.

##<a id="add-push"></a>Add push notifications to your app

###Verify Android SDK Version

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Verify SDK](../includes/mobile-services-verify-android-sdk-version.md)]

Your next step is to install Google Play services. Google Cloud Messaging has some minimum API level requirements for development and testing, which the **minSdkVersion** property in the Manifest must conform to. 

If you will be testing with an older device, then consult [Set Up Google Play Services SDK] to determine how low you can set this value, and set it appropriately.

###Add Google Play Services to the project

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Add Play Services](../includes/mobile-services-add-Google-play-services.md)]

###Add code

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push](../includes/mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push.md)]


##<a id="update-scripts"></a>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-portal-data-tables.png)

2. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.
   
  	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-insert-script-push2.png)

   	This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

		function insert(item, user, request) {
		// Define a payload for the Google Cloud Messaging toast notification.
		var payload = 
		    '{"data":{"message" : ' + item.text + ' }}';
		
		request.execute({
		    success: function() {
		        // If the insert succeeds, send a notification.
		        push.gcm.send(null, payload, {
		            success: function(pushResponse) {
		                console.log("Sent push:", pushResponse, payload);
		                request.respond();
		                },              
		            error: function (pushResponse) {
		                console.log("Error Sending push:", pushResponse);
		                request.respond(500, { error: pushResponse });
		                }
		            });
		        },
		    error: function(err) {
		        console.log("request.execute error", err)
		        request.respond();
		    }
		  });
		}

   	This registers a new insert script, which uses the [gcm object] to send a push notification to all registered devices after the insert succeeds. 

##<a id="test"></a>Test push notifications in your app

You can test the app by directly attaching an Android phone with a USB cable, or by using a virtual device in the emulator.

###Setting up the emulator for testing

When you run this app in the emulator, make sure that you use an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that supports Google APIs.

1. Restart Eclipse, then in Package Explorer, right-click the project, click **Properties**, click **Android**, check **Google APIs**, then click **OK**.

	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-import-android-properties.png)

  	This targets the project for the Google APIs.

2. From **Window**, select **Android Virtual Device Manager**, select your device, click **Edit**.

	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager.png)

3. Select **Google APIs** in **Target**, then click OK.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager-edit.png)

	This targets the AVD to use Google APIs.

###Running the test

1. From the **Run** menu in Eclipse, then click **Run** to start the app.

2. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the **Add** button.

  	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-quickstart-push1-android.png)

3. Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the device's Notification Center to see the notification.
