#What are Websites?

[WACOM.INCLUDE [disclaimer](../includes/disclaimer.md)]

Websites are web application hosts which support popular web application technologies such as .NET, Node.js and PHP without requiring any code changes to existing applications.  All of the common programming models and resources that .NET, Node.js and PHP developers use to access resources such as files and databases will continue to work as expected on websites deployed to Azure.  Websites provide access to file and database resources and to  all of the standard configuration files (such as web.config, php.ini and config.js) used by web applications today. A website is the host for a web application running in the cloud that you can control and manage.
