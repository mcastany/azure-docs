# Get started with data in Mobile Services

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-data](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-data.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a universal Windows app. Universal Windows app solutions include projects for both Windows Store 8.1 and Windows Phone Store 8.1 apps and a common shared project. For more information, see [Build universal Windows apps that target Windows and Windows Phone](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xaml/dn609832.aspx).

In this tutorial, you will download a Visual Studio 2013 project for a universal Windows app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then sign-in to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

>[WACOM.NOTE]This topic shows you how to use the tooling in Visual Studio Professional 2013 with Update 3 to connect a new mobile service to a universal Windows app. The same steps can be used to connect a mobile service to a Windows Store or Windows Phone Store 8.1 app. To connect a mobile service to an Windows Phone 8.0 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app, see [Get started with data for Windows Phone](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-phone-get-started-data).

> If you cannot upgrade to Visual Studio Professional 2013 Update 3 or you prefer manually add your mobile service project to a Windows Store app solution, see [this version](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-data) of the topic.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Windows Store app project][Get the Windows Store app] 
2. [Create the mobile service from Visual Studio]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use the mobile service]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]
6. [View uploaded data in the Azure Management Portal]

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-data%2F).
* <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Express 2013 for Windows</a> (Update 2 or a later version). 


##<a name="download-app"></a>Download the GetStartedWithData project

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-download-project](../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-dotnet-download-project.md)]
 

##<a name="create-service"></a>Create a new mobile service from Visual Studio

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013.md)]

<ol start="8"><li><p>In Solution Explorer, open the App.xaml.cs code file in the GetStartedWithData.Shared project folder, and notice the new static field that was added to the <strong>App</strong> class inside a Windows Store app conditional compilation block, which looks like the following example:</p> 

		<pre><code>public static Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient 
		    todolistClient = new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient(
		        "https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/",
		        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
		</code></pre>

	<p>This code provides access to your new mobile service in your app by using an instance of the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302030">MobileServiceClient class</a>. The client is created by supplying the URI and the application key of the new mobile service. This static field is available to all pages in your app.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Right-click the Windows Phone app project, click <strong>Add</strong>, click <strong>Connected Service...</strong>, select the mobile service that you just created, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </p>
<p>The same code is added to the shared App.xaml.cs file, but this time within a Windows Phone app conditional compilation block.</p></li>
</ol>

At this point, both the Windows Store and Windows Phone Store apps are connected to the new mobile service. The next step is to create a new TodoItem table in the mobile service.

##<a name="add-table"></a>Add a new table to the mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013.md)]

>[WACOM.NOTE]New tables are created with the Id, __createdAt, __updatedAt, and __version columns. When dynamic schema is enabled, Mobile Services automatically generates new columns based on the JSON object in the insert or update request. For more information, see [Dynamic schema](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj193175.aspx).

#<a name="update-app"></a>Update the app to use the mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-dotnet-update-data-app](../includes/mobile-services-windows-dotnet-update-data-app.md)]

##<a name="test-azure-hosted"></a>Test the mobile service hosted in Azure

Now we can test both versions of the universal Windows app against the mobile service hosted in Azure.

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-universal-test-app](../includes/mobile-services-windows-universal-test-app.md)]

<ol start="4">
<li><p>In the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/" target="_blank">Management Portal</a>, click <strong>Mobile Services</strong>, and then click your mobile service.<p></li>
<li><p>Click the <strong>Data</strong> tab, then click <strong>Browse</strong>.</p>
<p>Notice that the <strong>TodoItem</strong> table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.</p></li>
</ol>
