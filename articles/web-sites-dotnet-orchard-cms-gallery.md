# Create an Orchard CMS website from the gallery in Azure

The gallery makes available a wide range of popular web applications developed by Microsoft, third party companies, and open source software initiatives. Web applications created from the gallery do not require installation of any software other than the browser used to connect to the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com). For more information about the web applications in the gallery, see [Windows Web App Gallery](http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/categories.aspx).

In this tutorial, you'll learn:

- How to create a new site from the gallery

- How to launch and manage your site from the Management Portal
 
You'll build an Orchard CMS site that uses a default template. [Orchard](http://www.orchardproject.net/) is a free, open-source, .NET-based CMS application that allows you to create customized, content-driven websites. Orchard CMS includes an extensibility framework through which you can [download additional modules and themes](http://gallery.orchardproject.net/) to customize your site. The following illustration shows the Orchard CMS site that you will create.
