##<a id="webdeploy"></a>Web development and publishing

The Azure SDK 2.3 and Visual Studio 2013 Update 2 RC include several updates that streamline web development and publishing with Azure. You can now create an Azure website or virtual machine when you create a new web app. When you are ready to publish your website you can use the updated web publish dialog or PowerShell scripts that are added to your solution to deploy your site directly to an Azure website or virtual machine. Check out the following resources for more details and tutorials that describe how to leverage the new features:
