#Monitor a DocumentDB account  

You can monitor your DocumentDB accounts in the [Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com/). For each DocumentDB account, both performance metrics (such as requests and server errors) and usage metrics (such as storage consumption) are available.

## <a id="metrics"></a>  How to: View performance metrics for a DocumentDB account
1.	In the [Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse**, then **DocumentDB Accounts**, and then click the name of the DocumentDB account for which you would like to view performance metrics.
2.	Within the **Monitoring** lens you can, by default, see:
	*	Total requests for the current day.
	*	Average Requests per Second for the current day

3.	Clicking on the **Total Requests or Average Requests per Second** part opens a detailed **Metric** blade.
4.	The Metric blade shows you details about the metrics you have selected.  At the top of the blade is a graph and below that a table which shows aggregation values of the selected metrics such as average, minimum and maximum.  The metric blade also shows the list of alerts which have been defined, filtered to the metrics that appear on the current metric blade (this way, if you have a number of alerts, you'll only see the relevant ones presented here).

## <a id="custom"></a>  How to: Customize performance metric views for a DocumentDB account

1.	To customize the metrics that display in a particular part, right-click the metric chart, and then select **Edit Chart**.

2.	On the **Edit Chart** blade, there are options to modify the metrics that display in the part, as well as their time range.

3.	To change the metrics displayed in the part, simply check / uncheck the available performance metrics, and then click **Save** at the bottom of the blade.  
4.	To change the time range, choose a different range (for example, **Past Hour**), and then click **Save** at the bottom of the blade.  
	![][5] 

5.	The custom time range allows you to choose any period of time over the past 2 weeks.
6.	When you click **Save**, your changes persist until you leave the DocumentDB Account blade.  When you come back later, you'll see the original metrics and time range.  

## <a id="create"></a>  How to: Create side-by-side charts
The Azure Preview portal allows you to create side-by-side metric charts.  

1.	First, right-click on the chart from which you want to start and select **Customize**. 
	![](http://i.imgur.com/vLXWftF.png)

2.	Click **Clone** on the menu to copy the part. 

	![][7]  


3.	Finally, click **Done** on the toolbar at the top of the screen.  You may now treat this part as any other metric part, customizing the metrics and time range displayed in the part.  By doing this, you can see two different metrics chart side-by-side at the same time.   
	![][8] 

>Note that the chart time range and the chosen metrics are reset to the part's default values when you leave the Azure Preview portal.  

## <a id="view"></a>  How to: View usage metrics for a DocumentDB account
1.	In the [Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse**, then **DocumentDB Accounts**, and then click the name of the DocumentDB account for which you would like to see usage metrics.
2.	Within the **Usage** lens you can, by default, view:
	*	Storage consumed within the account
	*	Maximum available storage of the account
	*	Attachment usage
	*	Users and Permission usage
	*	Capacity Unit allocation 
	*	Attachment usage within the account

## <a id="setup"></a>  How to: Set up performance metric alerts for a DocumentDB account
1.	In the [Azure Preview portal](https://portal.azure.com/), click **Browse**, then **DocumentDB Accounts**, and then click the name of the DocumentDB account for which you would like to setup performance metric alerts.
2.	Within the **Operations** lens, click the **Alert rules** part.  
	![][10]

3.	In the Alert rules blade, click **Add Alert**.  
	![][11]

4.	In the **Add an alert rule** blade, specify:
	*	The name of the alert rule you are setting up.
	*	A description of the new alert rule.
	*	The metric for the alert rule.
	*	The condition, threshold, and period that determine when the alert activates. For example, a server error count greater than 5 over the last 15 minutes.
	*	Whether the service administrator and coadministrators are emailed when the alert fires.
	*	Additional email addresses for alert notifications.
