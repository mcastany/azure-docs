#Use the sample datasets in Azure Machine Learning Studio

ML Studio includes some sample datasets for you to use. These are standard machine learning datasets from the public domain. 

You can use these datasets in your experiments as you explore various types of analytic machine learning models in ML Studio. 

- To view a list of these standard datasets in ML Studio, click the **DATASETS** tab. For each dataset, you can see information such as the name of the dataset, who it was submitted by, and a brief description.
 
    To sort the datasets, click any column header. For example, click **SUBMITTED** BY to group all of the sample datasets provided by Microsoft Corporation. This is also an easy way to view datasets that you and other users in your workspace have imported. 

- To use a dataset in an experiment, expand the **Saved Datasets** section of the module palette to the left of the experiment canvas, or search for a specific dataset by typing the name in the search box above the palette. Drag the dataset onto the canvas to add it to your experiment. 

##Sample Datasets

The following table provides additional information about the datasets that might be useful to you while exploring the machine learning features of ML Studio. For each dataset, the table lists:
 
- The name and source of each dataset.
- A description of the dataset's possible uses, and citations to machine learning research that used the dataset.
- A summary of the important columns included in the dataset, and other useful attributes.

Some descriptions are adapted from the documentation provided by the source (typically the [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/ "UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository")), while other descriptions are based on additional investigation or reflect changes made in these samples.

<p>Telescope data</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Records of high energy gamma particle bursts along with background noise, both simulated using a Monte Carlo process.</p>
<p>The intent of the simulation was to improve the accuracy of ground-based atmospheric Cherenkov gamma telescopes, using statistical methods to differentiate between the desired signal (Cherenkov radiation showers) and background noise (hadronic showers initiated by cosmic rays in the upper atmosphere).</p>
<p>The data has been pre-processed to create an elongated cluster with the long axis is oriented towards the camera center. The characteristics of this ellipse, (often called Hillas parameters) are among the image parameters that can be used for discrimination.</p>
<p><strong>Usage:</strong> Predict whether image of a shower represents signal or background noise.</p>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Simple classification accuracy is not meaningful for this data, since classifying a background event as signal is worse than classifying a signal event as background. For comparison of different classifiers the ROC graph should be used. The probability of accepting a background event as signal must be below one of the following thresholds: 0.01 , 0.02 , 0.05 , 0.1 , or 0.2.</p>
<p>Also, note that the number of background events (h, for hadronic showers) is underestimated, whereas in real measurements, the h or noise class represents the majority of events.</p>
