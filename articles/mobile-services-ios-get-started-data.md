This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in an iOS app. In this tutorial, you will download an app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then login to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial is intended to help you better understand how Mobile Services enables you to use Azure to store and retrieve data from an iOS app. As such, this topic walks you through many of the steps that are completed for you in the Mobile Services quickstart. If this is your first experience with Mobile Services, consider first completing the tutorial <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-ios">Get started with Mobile Services</a>.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the iOS app project] 
2. [Create the mobile service]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use Mobile Services]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

This tutorial requires the following:

+ [Mobile Services iOS SDK] and [XCode 4.5][Install Xcode] and iOS 5.0 or later versions.
+ A Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A756A2826&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-with-data-ios%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.</p></div> 

##<a name="download-app"></a>Download the GetStartedWithData project
 
This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithData app][GitHub], which is an iOS app. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services iOS quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. 

1. Download the GetStartedWithData [sample app][GitHub]. 

2. In Xcode, open the downloaded project and examine the TodoService.m file.

   	Notice that there are eight **// TODO** comments that specify the steps you must take to make this app work with your mobile service.

3. Press the **Run** button (or the Command+R key) to rebuild the project and start the app.

4. In the app, type some text in the text box, then click the **+** button.

   	![][0]  

   	Notice that the saved text is displayed in the list below.

##<a name="create-service"></a>Create a new mobile service in the Management Portal

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data.md)]

##<a name="add-table"></a>Add a new table to the mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2.md)]

##<a name="update-app"></a>Update the app to use the mobile service for data access

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-ios-enable-mobile-service-access](../includes/mobile-services-ios-enable-mobile-service-access.md)]

##<a name="test-app"></a>Test the app against your new mobile service

1. In Xcode, select an emulator to deploy to (either iPhone or iPad), press the **Run** button (or the Command+R key) to rebuild the project and start the app.

   	This executes your Azure Mobile Services client, built with the iOS SDK, that queries items from your mobile service.

2. As before, type text in the textbox, and then click the **+** button..

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]
  
   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial for iOS.

##<a name="next-steps"></a>Next steps

This tutorial demonstrated the basics of enabling an iOS app to work with data in Mobile Services. 

Next, consider completing one of the following tutorials that is based on the GetStartedWithData app that you created in this tutorial:

* [Validate and modify data with scripts]
  <br/>Learn more about using server scripts in Mobile Services to validate and change data sent from your app.

* [Refine queries with paging]
  <br/>Learn how to use paging in queries to control the amount of data handled in a single request.

Once you have completed the data series, try these other iOS tutorials:

* [Get started with authentication] 
	<br/>Learn how to authenticate users of your app.

* [Get started with push notifications] 
  <br/>Learn how to send a very basic push notification to your app with Mobile Services.
