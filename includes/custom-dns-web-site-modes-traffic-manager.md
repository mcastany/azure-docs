Setting a custom domain name on a website that is load balanced by Traffic Manager is only available for Standard mode websites. Before switching a website from the Free website mode to the Shared, Basic or Standard mode, you must first remove spending caps in place for your Website subscription. 

For more information on the Website modes modes, including how to change the mode of your site, see [How to scale web sites](/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale/).
