[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started.md)]

This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a universal Windows app using Azure Mobile Services. 

In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple *To do list* app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses JavaScript for server-side business logic. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio, see the .NET backend version of this topic.

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fazure.microsoft.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started%2F).
* [Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows] 

## Create a new mobile service

## Create a new universal Windows app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new universal Windows app or modify an existing Windows Store or Windows Phone app project to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new universal Windows app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

   
2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Store app**.

   	This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Store app connected to your mobile service.

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install [Visual Studio 2013][Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows] on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Click **Create TodoItem table** to create a table to store app data.

5. Under **Download and run your app**, select a language for your app, then click **Download**. 

  	This downloads the project for the sample *To do list* application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Run your Windows app

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-javascript-backend-run-app](../includes/mobile-services-javascript-backend-run-app.md)]

>[WACOM.NOTE]You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the default.js file.

## Next Steps
Now that you have completed the quickstart, learn how to perform additional important tasks in Mobile Services: 

* [Get started with data]
  <br/>Learn more about storing and querying data using Mobile Services.

* [Get started with authentication]
  <br/>Learn how to authenticate users of your app with an identity provider.

* [Get started with push notifications] 
  <br/>Learn how to send a very basic push notification to your app.
