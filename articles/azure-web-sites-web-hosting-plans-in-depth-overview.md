#Azure Websites Web Hosting Plans In-Depth Overview#
</br>
Web hosting plans (WHPs) represent a set of features and capacity that you can share across your websites.  Web hosting plans support the 4 Azure Websites pricing tiers (Free, Shared, Basic, and Standard) where each tier has its own capabilities and capacity.  Sites in the same subscription, resource group, and geographic location can share a web hosting plan. All the sites sharing a web hosting plan can leverage all the capabilities and features defined by the web hosting plan tier. All websites associated with a given web hosting plan run on the resources defined by the web hosting plan. For example, if your web hosting plan is configured to use two "small" virtual machines, all sites associated with that web hosting plan will run on both virtual machines. As always with Azure Websites, the virtual machines your sites are running on are fully managed and highly available.
</br>
In this article we'll explore the key characteristics such as tier and scale of a Web Hosting Plan and how they come into play while managing your websites. 
</br>
##Websites, Web Hosting Plans, and Resource Groups##
</br>
A website can be associated with only one web hosting plan at any given time. A web hosting plan is associated with a resource group. A Resource group is a new concept in Azure that serves as the lifecycle boundary for every resource contained within it. Resource groups enable you to manage all the pieces of an application together. 
</br>
You can have multiple web hosting plans in a resource group and each hosting plan will have its own set of features and capabilities that are utilized by its associated sites.  The following image illustrates this relationship:
</br>
</br>
![Resource Groups and Web Hosting Plans](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview01.png)
</br>
</br>
The ability to have multiple web hosting plans in a single resource group allows you to allocate different sites to different resources, primarily virtual machines running your websites. For example, this ability allows separation of resources between dev and test and production sites, where you might want to allocate one web hosting plan with its own dedicated set of resources for your production sites, and a second web hosting plan for your dev and test sites. 
</br>
Having multiple web hosting plans in a single resource group also allows you to define an application that spans across regions. For example, a highly available website running in two regions will include two websites, one for each region, and one website associated with each web hosting plan. In such a situation, all the sites will be associated with a single resource group, which defines one application.  Having a single view of a resource group with multiple web hosting plans and multiple sites makes it easy to manage, control and view the health of the websites. On top of managing websites resources and respective sites for a given application, you can associated any related Azure resource such as SQL-Azure databases, and Team Projects. 
</br>
##When should I create a new resource group and when should I create a new web hosting plan?##
</br>
When creating a new website, you should consider creating a new resource group when the website you are about to create represents a new web application. In this case, creating a new resource group, an associated web hosting plan, and a websites is the right choice.  When creating such a new website through the new Azure portal preview, using the gallery or the new website + SQL option, the portal will default to create a new resource group and web hosting plan for your new site. If you need to, though, you can overwrite these defaults.
</br>
</br>
![Creating a new Web Hosting Plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview02.png)
</br>
</br>
You can always add a new website, or any other resources, to an existing resource group. When creating a new website from the context of an existing resource group, the new website wizard defaults to the existing resource and web hosting plan. Here too you can overwrite these defaults as needed. When adding a new website to an existing resource group, you can choose to add the site to an existing web hosting plan (this is the default option in the new Azure portal preview), or you can create a new web hosting plan to add the site to.
</br>
Creating a new hosting plan allows you to allocate a new set of resource for your websites, and provides you with greater control over resource allocation, as each web hosting plan gets its own set of virtual machines. Since you can move websites between web hosting plans, assuming the web hosting plans are in the same regions, the decision of whether to create a new web hosting plan or not is of less important. If a given website starts consuming too many resources or you just need to separate a few websites, you can create a new web hosting plan and move your websites to it.
</br>
If you want to create a new website in a different region, and that region doesn't have an existing web hosting plan, you will have to create a new web hosting plan in that region to be able to have a website associated with it. 
</br>
An important thing to keep in mind is that you cannot move web hosting plans or websites between resource groups. Also, you cannot move a website between two web hosting plans that are in two separate regions. 
</br>
##Existing resources group in the Azure Preview portal##
</br>
If you already have existing websites on Azure Websites, you will notice that all your websites show up in the Azure preview portal. You can see all your website as a flat list by clicking on the **browse** button on the left navigation pane and selecting **Websites**:
</br>
</br>
![See all your website as a flat list](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview03.png)
</br>
</br>
You can also see all the resource groups that have been created for you by clicking on the **browse** button on the left navigation pane and selecting **Resource groups**:
</br>
</br>
![See all the resource groups that have been created](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview04.png)
</br>
</br>
You will also notice that you have an auto-generated default resource group in each region you already have websites. The auto generated resource group name for websites is *Default-Web-<LOCATION NAME>*where location name represents an Azure region (for example *Default-Web-WestUS*). In each resource group you will find all your existing sites for the group's region. Each site you created in the past and will create in the future in either the Full Azure portal or the Azure Preview Portal will be available on both portals. 
</br>
Since every website has to be associated with a web hosting plan, we have created default web hosting plans for your existing sites according to the following convention, in each region:
</br>
* All your **Free** websites are associated with a **Default** web hosting plan and its pricing tier set to **Free**. 
</br>
* All your **Shared** websites are associated with a **Default** web hosting plan and its pricing tier set to **Shared**
</br>
* All your **Standard** websites are associated with a default web hosting plan and its pricing tier set to **Standard**. 
</br>
The name of this web hosting plan is **DefaultServerFarm**. This name was chosen to support a legacy API. The name **ServerFarm** can be somewhat misleading as it refers to a **Web Hosting Plan**, but it's important to notice that it is a name of a web hosting plan and it is not an entity of its own. 
</br>
##Web Hosting Plan F.A.Q.##
</br>
**Question**: How do I create a Web Hosting Plan?
</br>
**Answer**: A Web Hosting Plan is a container and as such, you can't create an empty Web Hosting Plan. However, a new Web Hosting Plan is explicitly created during site creation.
</br>
To do this using the UI in the new **Azure Portal Preview** click **NEW** and select **Website**, which will open the Website creation blade. In the first image below you can see the **NEW** icon on the bottom left, and in the second image you can see the **Website** creation blade, the **Web Hosting Plan** blade and the **Pricing Tier** blade:
</br>
</br>
![Create a new website](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview05.png)
</br>
</br>
![Website, Web Hosting Plan and pricing tier blades](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview06.png)
</br>
</br>
For this example we are choosing to create a new Website called **contosomarketing** and to place it in the new web hosting plan called **contoso**. The Pricing Tier selected for this Web Hosting Plan is **Small Standard**. For more details on Webhosting Plan Pricing Tiers as well as the features, pricing and scale options provided in each please visit the [Azure Websites Web Hosting Plans Spec](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9845586). 
</br>
It should also be noted that a Web Hosting Plan can also be created in the existing Azure Portal. This is done as part of the **quick create** wizard by selecting **Create new web hosting plan** from the **WEB HOSTING PLAN** drop down:
</br>
</br>
![Create new web hosting plan in the existing portal](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview07.png)
</br>
</br>
For this example we are creating a new site called **northwind** and we are choosing to create a new web hosting plan. The result of this operation will be a new web hosting plan called **default0** which contains the **northwind** website. All webhosting plans created through this experience follow this naming convention, and Web Hosting Plans cannot be renamed after having been created. Also, Web Hosting Plans created through this process will be created in the **Free** pricing tier.
</br>
**Question**: How do I assign a site to a **Web Hosting Plan**?
</br>
**Answer**: Sites are assigned to a Web Hosting Plan as part of the site creation process. To do this using the UI in the new **Azure Portal Preview**, click **NEW** and select **Website**:
</br>
</br>
![Create a new website](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview08.png)
</br>
</br>
Then, in the Website creation blade, select the hosting plan:
</br>
</br>
![Select a hosting plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview09.png)
</br>
</br>
A site can also be created into a specific Web Hosting Plan using the existing Azure Portal. This is done as part of the **quick create** wizard. After typing in the website URL, use the **WEB HOSTING PLAN** drop-down to select a plan to add the site to:
</br>
</br>
![Select a hosting plan in the existing portal](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview10.png)
</br>
</br>
**Question**: How can I move a site to a different web hosting plan?
</br>
**Answer**: You can move a site to a different web hosting plan using the Azure Preview Portal. Websites can be moved between web hosting plans in the same geographical region that belong to the same resource group.
</br>
To move a site to another plan, navigate to the website blade of the site you want to move.  Then click **Web Hosting Plan**:
</br>
</br>
![Choose a new or existing web hosting plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview22.png)
</br>
</br>
This will open the Web Hosting Plan blade. At this point, you can either pick an existing web hosting plan, or create a new one. Plans in a different geographical location or resource group are grayed out and cannot be selected.
</br>
Note that each web hosting plan has its own pricing tier. When you move a site from a **Free** tier web hosting plan to a **Standard** web hosting plan, your website will be able to leverage all the features and resources of the Standard tier. 
</br>
</br>
**Question**: How can I Scale a Web Hosting Plan?
</br>
**Answer**: There are two ways to scale a Web Hosting Plan. One way is to scale up your web hosting plan and all sites associated with that web hosting plan. By changing the pricing tier of a web hosting plan, all sites in that web hosting plan will be subject to the features and resources defined by that pricing tier. 
</br>
In the image below you can see the **Web Hosting Plan** blade as well as the **Pricing Tier** blade. Clicking on the **Pricing Tier** part in the **Web Hosting Plan** blade expands the **Pricing Tier** blade where you can change the pricing tier for the web hosting plan:
</br>
</br>
![The Web Hosting Plan blade and the Pricing Tier](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview16.png)
</br>
</br>
The second way to scale a plan is to scale it out by increasing the number of instances in your Web Hosting Plan. In the image below you can see the **Web Hosting Plan** blade as well as the **Scale** blade. Clicking on the Scale area in the **Web Hosting Plan** blade expands it and allows changing the instance count of the plan:
</br>
</br>
![Changing the instance count of a hosting plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview17.png)
</br>
</br>
Since the Web Hosting Plan in the above image is configured to use the **Standard** pricing tier, the **AutoScale** option is enabled. 
</br>
Performing this in the Full Azure Portal can be done in the **Scale** tab, as seen below:
</br>
</br>
![Changing the instance count of a hosting plan in the existing portal](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview18.png)
</br>
</br>
**Question**: How Can I Delete a Web Hosting Plan?
</br>
**Answer**: To delete a Web Hosting Plan you must first delete all websites associated with it. Once all the Websites in a Web Hosting Plan have been deleted a Web Hosting Plan can be deleted from the Web Hosting Plan blade:
</br>
</br>
![Deleting a web hosting plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview19.png)
</br>
</br>
In the Full Azure Portal deleting the last website in a web hosting plan will automatically delete the associated web hosting plan.
</br>
**Question**: How Can I monitor a web hosting plan?
</br>
**Answer**: Web Hosting Plans can be monitored using the Monitoring parts in the Web Hosting Plan Blade:
</br>
</br>
![Monitoring a web hosting plan](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview20.png)
</br>
</br>
The monitoring controls can be customized by right clicking on the control and selecting **edit query**:
</br>
</br>
![Editing the monitoring controls](./media/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview21.png)
</br>
</br>
The metrics exposed are:
</br>
* CPU Percentage
</br>
* Memory Percentage
</br>
* Disk Queue Length 
</br>
* HTTP Queue Length. 
</br>
This metrics represent the average usage across instances belonging to a Web Hosting Plan. All of these metrics can be used to set up alerts as well as Auto Scale rules.
</br>
##Take away and Conclusions##
</br>
Web hosting plans represent a set of features and capacity that you can share across your websites.  A Web hosting Plan give you the flexibility to allocate specific sites to a given resource set- Virtual Machines, and further optimize you Azure resource allocation and usage for Websites.
