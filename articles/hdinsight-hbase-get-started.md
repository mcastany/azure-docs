# Get started using HBase with Hadoop in HDInsight
HBase is a low-latency NoSQL database that allows online transactional processing of big data. HBase is offered as a managed cluster integrated into the Azure environment. The clusters are configured to store data directly in Azure Blob storage, which provides low latency and increased elasticity in performance/cost choices. This enables customers to build interactive websites that work with large datasets, to build services that store sensor and telemetry data from millions of end points, and to analyze this data with Hadoop jobs. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to create and query HBase tables with HDInsight. The following procedures are described:

- How to provision an HBase cluster using the Azure portal.
- How to enable and use RDP to access the HBase shell and use the HBase shell to create an HBase sample table, add rows, and then list the rows in the table.
- How to create a Hive table that maps to an existing HBase table and use HiveQL to query the data in the HBase table.
- How to use the .NET SDK to create a new HBase table, list the HBase tables in your account, and how to add and retrieve the rows from your tables.


> [WACOM.NOTE] HBase is currently only available in preview for use with HDInsight 3.0 clusters on HDInsight (based on Hadoop 2.2.0). For version information, see [What's new in the Hadoop cluster versions provided by HDInsight?][hdinsight-versions]

During preview period, it is recommended that a backup copy of the original version of any data used in the HBase cluster be stored outside of that cluster. This is because the format of the database files may be changed in future versions and the current data file formats used in the preview version may not be supported or upgradable to subsequent versions.

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following:

- An Azure subscription. For more information about obtaining a subscription, see [Purchase Options][azure-purchase-options], [Member Offers][azure-member-offers], or [Free Trial][azure-free-trial].
- An Azure storage account. For instructions, see [How To Create a Storage Account][azure-create-storageaccount].
- A copy of Visual Studio.

**Estimated time to complete:** 30 minutes

4. Click on the check icon on the lower left to create the HBase cluster.


##<a name="create-sample-table"></a>Create an HBase sample table from the HBase shell
This section describes how to enable and use the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access the HBase shell and then use it to create an HBase sample table, add rows, and then list the rows in the table.

It assumes you have completed the procedure outlined in the first section, and so have already successfully created an HBase cluster.

**Enable the RDP connection to the HBase cluster**

1. To enable a Remote Desktop Connection to the HDInsight cluster, select the HBase cluster you have created and click the **CONFIGURATION** tab. Click the **ENABLE REMOTE** button at the bottom of the page to enable the RDP connection to the cluster.
2. Provide the credentials and expiration date on the **CONFIGURE REMOTE DESKTOP** wizard and click the checked circle on the lower right. (It might take a few minutes for the operation to complete.)
3. To connect to the HDInsight cluster, click on the **CONNECT** button at the bottom of the **CONFIGURATION** tab.

 
**Open the HBase Shell**

1. Within your RDP session, click on the **Hadoop Command Prompt** shortcut located on the desktop.

2. Change the folder to the HBase home directory:
		
		cd %HBASE_HOME%\bin

3. Open the HBase shell:

		hbase shell


**Create a sample table, add data and retrieve the data**

1. Create a sample table:

		create 'sampletable', 'cf1'

2. Add a row to the sample table:

		put 'sampletable', 'row1', 'cf1:col1', 'value1'

3. List the rows in the sample table:
	
		scan 'sampletable'

##<a name="hive-query"></a>Use Hive to query an HBase table

Now you have an HBase cluster provisioned and have created a table, you can query it using Hive. This section creates a Hive table that maps to the HBase table and uses it to queries the data in your HBase table.

**To open cluster dashboard**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal]. 
2. Click **HDINSIGHT** from the left pane. You shall see a list of clusters created including the one you just created in the last section.
3. Click the cluster name where you want to run the Hive job.
4. Click **MANAGE CLUSTER** from the bottom of the page to open cluster dashboard. It opens a Web page on a different browser tab.   
5. Enter the Hadoop User account username and password.  The default username is **admin**, the password is what you entered during the provision process.  The dashboard looks like :

**To run an Hive query**

1. To create a Hive Table with a mapping to HBase table, enter HiveQL script below into Hive console window and click **SUBMIT** button. Make sure that you have created the sampletable referenced here in HBase using the HBase Shell before executing this statement.

	    SET hbase.zookeeper.quorum=zookeeper0,zookeeper1,zookeeper2;  
    	CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE hbasesampletable(rowkey STRING, col1 STRING, col2 STRING)
    	STORED BY 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.hbase.HBaseStorageHandler'
    	WITH SERDEPROPERTIES ('hbase.columns.mapping' = ':key,cf1:col1,cf1:col2')
    	TBLPROPERTIES ('hbase.table.name' = 'sampletable');

 
2. To execute a Hive Query Over the Data in HBase, enter the HiveQL script below into Hive console window and click **SUBMIT** button.

	    SET hbase.zookeeper.quorum=zookeeper0,zookeeper1,zookeeper2;
    	SET hive.aux.jars.path=file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/hive-hbase-handler-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677.jar,file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/hbase-server-0.96.0.2.0.9.0-1677-hadoop2.jar,file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/hbase-protocol-0.96.0.2.0.9.0-1677-hadoop2.jar,file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/htrace-core-2.01.jar,file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/hbase-client-0.96.0.2.0.9.0-1677-hadoop2.jar,file:///C:/Apps/dist/hive-0.12.0.2.0.9.0-1677/lib/guava-12.0.1.jar;
     	SELECT count(*) FROM hbasesampletable;
 
4. To retrieve the results of the Hive query, click on the **View Details** link in the **Job Session** window when the job finishes executing.


Note: The HBase shell link switches the tab to the **HBase Shell**.



**To browse the output file**

1. From the cluster dashboard, click **Files** from the top.
2. Click **Templeton-Job-Status**.
3. Click the GUID number which has the last Modified time a little after the Job Start Time you wrote down earlier. Make a note of this GUID.  You will need it in the next section.
4. The **stdout** file has the data you need in the next section. You can click **stdout** to download a copy of the data file if you want.

	
##<a name="hbase-powershell"></a>Use HBase C# APIs to create an HBase table and retrieve data from the table

Marlin is a thin layer on top of the REST API, which takes care of interacting with HBase using ProtoBuf in C#. The Marlin project must be downloaded from github and the project built to use the HBase .NET SDK.

1. Follow the build steps described onDownload the Marlin project from the [Marlin's project page](https://github.com/thomasjungblut/marlin). Unzip it to a local directory. 

2. Open the project up in Visual Studio. Open up the Manage NuGet Package Manager wizard by going to the **TOOLS** menus -> **Library Package Manager** and select **Manage NuGet packages for Solution ...** 
	
	![](http://i.imgur.com/hUNoJDJ.jpg)

3. Search in the Online box on the upper right for protobuf-net and install v2.0.0.68. Build the Marlin project by right-clicking on the  **Marlin** project in the **Solution Explorer** and selecting **Build**. 

4. Retrieve the resulting marlin.dll built and add it to your C# project.

5. Create a new instance of Marlin using the cluster credentials and retrieve the cluster version:

		var credentials = ClusterCredentials.Create("https://yourclustername.azurehdinsight.net/", "user", "password");
		    var marlin = new Marlin(credentials);
		// retrieve the version as a test
		var version = marlin.GetVersion();
		Console.WriteLine(version);

6. To list the tables in the cluster, you can use the following code: 

		var tables = marlin.ListTables();
		foreach(var tableName in tables.name) 
		        Console.WriteLine(tableName);

7. To create a new HBase table, use this code:

	    var schema = new TableSchema();
	    schema.name = "sampletable";
	    schema.columns.Add(new ColumnSchema() { name = "cf1" });
	    schema.columns.Add(new ColumnSchema() { name = "cf2" });
	    marlin.CreateTable(schema);

8. To retrieve a row by its key, specify the table name and a row key to retrieve a row value. 

		var cells = marlin.GetCells("sampletable", "row1");
		var row = cells.rows[0];
		    foreach(var val in row.values) 
		    {
		       Console.WriteLine(Encoding.UTF8.GetString(val.data));
		    }

9. To store a new row of data, you can use the following code:

		CellSet set = new CellSet();
		CellSet.Row row = new CellSet.Row() { key = BitConverter.GetBytes(1337) };
		    var value = new Cell()
		            {
		                column = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("cf1:d"),
		                data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("Hello World!")
		            };
		    row.values.Add(value);
		    set.rows.Add(row);
		marlin.StoreCells("sampletable", set);
