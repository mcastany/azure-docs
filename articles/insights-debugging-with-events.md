3. Then choose any resource (depending on which events you are interested in). For illustration purposes, the screenshots in this document include the Event for resource groups.

5. The resource group blade includes a part called **Events in the past week**. Each of the bars on that part, represent the number of events that have happened on each of days of the past week. Each of bars can have two different colors: blue and pink. Pink represents **Failed** events on that day, and blue represents all other events.
