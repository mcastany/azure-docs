#Develop a predictive solution with Azure Machine Learning
 
Suppose you need to predict an individual's credit risk based on the information they give on a credit application.  

That's a complex problem, of course, but let's simplify the parameters of the question a bit and use it as an example of how you might be able to use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning with ML Studio and ML API service to create such a predictive analytics solution.  

In this walkthrough, we'll follow the process of developing a predictive analytics model in ML Studio and then publishing it to the ML API service. We'll start with publicly-available credit risk data, develop and train a predictive model based on that data, and then publish the model as a web service that can be used by others.  

We'll follow these steps:  

1.	[Create an ML workspace][create-workspace]
2.	[Upload existing data][upload-data]
3.	[Create a new experiment][create-new]
4.	[Train and evaluate the models][train-models]
5.	[Publish the web service][publish]
6.	[Access the web service][access-ws]

This walkthrough is based on a simplified version of the 
[Credit risk prediction sample experiment][risk] included with ML Studio.
