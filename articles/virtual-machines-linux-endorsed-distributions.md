#Linux on Azure-Endorsed Distributions

The distribution images on the Azure Gallery are provided by the following partners, and we are working with the various Linux communities to bring even more endorsed distributions. In the meantime, for distributions not available from the Gallery you can always Bring Your Own Linux by following the guidelines on [this page](../virtual-machines-linux-create-upload-vhd/).

## Canonical ##

## Supported Versions ##

The following table shows the different distribution versions, Linux Integration Services (LIS) drivers and Azure Linux Agent versions that have been tested to work on Azure. LIS drivers are either built into the distribution's kernel by default, or are available [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=403033&clcid=0x409). Linux Agent versions are available from the distribution's package repository or on [Github](https://github.com/azure/walinuxagent).

The table also includes a link to the [Linux kernel compatibility patch](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=403027&clcid=0x409) required by some distribution/kernel versions to work optimally in Azure.
