<p>This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a Windows Store app. In this tutorial, you will download a Visual Studio 2012 project for an app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then login to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app. You can view a video version of this tutorial by clicking the clip to the right.</p>

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial adds Mobile Services functionality to a Windows Store app created in Visual Studio 2012. Visual Studio 2013 includes new features that make it easy to connect your Windows Store app to Mobile Services. For more information, see <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-dotnet/">Get started with data in Mobile Services</a>.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Windows Store app project][Get the Windows Store app] 
2. [Create the mobile service]
3. [Add a data table for storage]
4. [Update the app to use Mobile Services]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes.

<h2><a name="download-app"></a><span class="short-header">Download the project</span>Download the GetStartedWithData project</h2>

This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithData app][Developer Code Samples site], which is a Windows Store app. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. 

1. Download the C# version of the GetStartedWithData sample app from the [Developer Code Samples site]. 

   	![][10]

2. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the downloaded project and examine the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

   	Notice that added **TodoItem** objects are stored in an in-memory **ObservableCollection&lt;TodoItem&gt;**.

3. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.

4. In the app, type some text in **Insert a TodoItem**, then click **Save**.

   	![][0]  

   	Notice that the saved text is displayed in the second column under **Query and update data**.

<h2><a name="create-service"></a><span class="short-header">Create mobile service</span>Create a new mobile service in the Management Portal</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data.md)]

<h2><a name="add-table"></a><span class="short-header">Add a new table</span>Add a new table to the mobile service</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-data-2.md)]

<h2><a name="update-app"></a><span class="short-header">Update the app</span>Update the app to use the mobile service for data access</h2>

Now that your mobile service is ready, you can update the app to store items in Mobile Services instead of the local collection. 

1. In **Solution Explorer** in Visual Studio, right-click the project name, and then select **Manage NuGet Packages**.

2. In the left pane, select the **Online** category, select **Include Prerelease**, search for `WindowsAzure.MobileServices`, click **Install** on the **Azure Mobile Services** package, then accept the license agreement. 

  	![][7]

  	This adds the Mobile Services client library to the project.

3. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service you just created.

4. Click the **Dashboard** tab and make a note of the **Site URL**, then click **Manage keys** and make a note of the **Application key**.

   	![][8]

  	You will need these values when accessing the mobile service from your app code.

5. In Visual Studio, open the file App.xaml.cs and add or uncomment the following `using` statement:

       	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;

6. In this same file, uncomment the code that defines the **MobileService** variable, and supply the URL and application key from the mobile service in the **MobileServiceClient** constructor, in that order.

		//public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient( 
        //    "AppUrl", 
        //    "AppKey" 
        //); 

  	This creates a new instance of **MobileServiceClient** that is used to access your mobile service.

6. In the file MainPage.xaml.cs, add or uncomment the following `using` statements:

       	using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
		using Newtonsoft.Json;

7. In this same file, replace the **TodoItem** class definition with the following code:

        public class TodoItem
        {
            public string Id { get; set; }

            [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
            public string Text { get; set; }

            [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")]
            public bool Complete { get; set; }
        }

7. Comment the line that defines the existing **items** collection, then uncomment the following lines:

        private MobileServiceCollection<TodoItem, TodoItem> items;
        private IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable = 
			App.MobileService.GetTable<TodoItem>();

   	This code creates a mobile services-aware binding collection (**items**) and a proxy class for the SQL Database table **TodoItem** (**todoTable**). 

7. In the **InsertTodoItem** method, remove the line of code that sets the **TodoItem**.**Id** property, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code:

        await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);

  	This code inserts a new item into the table.

8. In the **RefreshTodoItems** method, add the **async** modifier to the method, then uncomment the following line of code:

        items = await todoTable.ToCollectionAsync();

   	This sets the binding to the collection of items in the todoTable, which contains all TodoItem objects returned from the mobile service. 

9. In the **UpdateCheckedTodoItem** method, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code:

         await todoTable.UpdateAsync(item);

   	This sends an item update to the mobile service.

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for backend storage, it's time to test the app against Mobile Services.

<h2><a name="test-app"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test the app against your new mobile service</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. As before, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]
  
   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

5. In the app, check one of the items in the list, then go back to the Browse tab in the portal and click **Refresh**. 

  	Notice that the complete value has changed from **false** to **true**.

6. In the MainPage.xaml.cs project file, replace the existing **RefreshTodoItems** method with the following code that filters out completed items:

        private async void RefreshTodoItems()
        {                       
            // This query filters out completed TodoItems. 
            items = await todoTable
               .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
               .ToCollectionAsync();

            ListItems.ItemsSource = items;            
        }

7. In the app, check another one of the items in the list and then click the **Refresh** button.

   	Notice that the checked item now disappears from the list. Each refresh results in a round-trip to the mobile service, which now returns filtered data.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial.
