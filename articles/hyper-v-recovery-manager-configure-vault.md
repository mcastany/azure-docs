	<li>Select the private key (.pfx) that you imported to the VMM server.</li>
	<li>Select the vault in which you want to register the server.</li>
	<li>Specify in the vault key. This is the vault key you generated earlier. Cut and paste the key value from the Quick Start page.</li>
	</ul>

	![Certificate Register](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_CertReg1.png)


6. On the Data Encryption page, you specify whether you want to allow the option to encrypt data during replication for a specific cloud. If you select this option, an SSL certificate will be automatically generated. When you run a failover, you’ll need to select this certificate. After you enable this setting, you can enable or disable data encryption for a cloud in the Azure Site Recovery portal. For this tutorial leave the default setting and click <b>Next</b>.


	![Certificate Vault](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_CertReg2.png)

7. On the VMM Server page, do the following:

	- Specify a friendly name for the VMM server. This name is used to identify the server in the Azure Site Recovery console.
	- Select <b>Synchronize cloud metadata with the vault</b> to synchronize information about VMM clouds with Azure Site Recovery vault. This action only needs to happen once on each server. If you don't want to synchronize all clouds, you can publish each cloud individually to synchronize it, before you configure cloud protection settings. 

8. Click <b>Register</b> to complete the process. 

	![PublishCloud](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMMServerName.png)


<P>After a server has been successfully registered its friendly name will be displayed on the <b>Resources</b> tab on the Servers page in the vault.</P>




<h2><a id="clouds"></a>Step 5: Configure cloud protection settings</h2>

After VMM servers are registered, you can configure cloud protection settings. You enabled the option **Synchronize cloud data with the vault** when you installed the Provider so all clouds on the VMM server will appear in the <b>Protected Items</b> tab in the vault.

1. On the Quick Start page, click **Set up protection for VMM clouds**.

![Enable cloud protection](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_EnableCloudProtection.png)

2. On the **Protected Items** tab, select the cloud that you want to configure and go to the **Configuration** tab. Note that:

3. In <b>Target</b>, select <b>VMM</b>.
4. In <b>Target location</b>, select the on-site VMM server that manages the cloud you want to use for recovery.
4. In <b>Target cloud</b>, select the target cloud you want to use for failover of virtual machines in the source cloud. Note that:
	- We recommend that you select a target cloud that meets recovery requirements for the virtual machines you'll protect.
	- A cloud can only belong to a single cloud pair — either as a primary or a target cloud.

6. In <b>Copy frequency</b> leave the default setting. This value specifies how frequently data should be synchronized between source and target locations. It's only relevant when the Hyper-V host is running Windows Server 2012 R2. For other servers a default setting of five minutes is used.
7. In <b>Additional recovery points</b>, leave the default setting. This value specifies whether you want to create addition recovery points.The default zero value specifies that only the latest recovery point for a primary virtual machine is stored on a replica host server.
8. In <b>Frequency of application-consistent snapshots</b>, leave the default setting. This value specifies how often to create snapshots. Snapshots use Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to ensure that applications are in a consistent state when the snapshot is taken.  If you do want to set this value for the tutorial walkthrough, ensure that it is set to less than the number of additional recovery points you configure.
	![Configure protection settings](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_CloudConfigureE2E1.png)
9. In <b>Data transfer compressed</b>, specify whether replicated data that is transferred should be compressed. 
10. In <b>Authentication</b>, specify how traffic is authenticated between the primary and recovery Hyper-V host servers. For the purpose of this walkthrough select HTTPS unless you have a working Kerberos environment configured. Azure Site Recovery will automatically configure certificates for HTTPS authentication. No manual configuration is required. Note that this setting is only relevant for Hyper-V host servers running on Windows Server 2012 R2.
11. In <b>Port</b>, leave the default setting. This value sets the port number on which the source and target Hyper-V host computers listen for replication traffic.
12. In <b>Replication method</b>, specify how the initial replication of data from source to target locations will be handled, before regular replication starts. 
	- <b>Over network</b>—Copying data over the network can be time-consuming and resource-intensive. We recommend that you use this option if the cloud contains virtual machines with relatively small virtual hard disks, and if the primary VMM server is connected to the secondary VMM server over a connection with wide bandwidth. You can specify that the copy should start immediately, or select a time. If you use network replication, we recommend that you schedule it during off-peak hours.
	- <b>Offline</b>—This method specifies that the initial replication will be performed using external media. It's useful if you want to avoid degradation in network performance, or for geographically remote locations. To use this method you specify the export location on the source cloud, and the import location on the target cloud. When you enable protection for a virtual machine, the virtual hard disk is copied to the specified export location. You send it to the target site, and copy it to the import location. The system copies the imported information to the replica virtual machines. For a complete list of offline replication prerequisites, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=323469">Step 3: Configure protection settings for VMM clouds</a> in the Deployment Guide.
	![Configure protection settings](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_CloudConfigureE2E2.png)

<p>After you save the settings a job will be created and can be monitored on the <b>Jobs</b> tab. All Hyper-V host servers in the VMM source cloud will be configured for replication. Cloud settings can be modified on the <b>Configure</b> tab. If you want to modify the target location or target cloud you must remove the cloud configuration, and then reconfigure the cloud.</p>


<h2><a id="networkmapping"></a>Step 6: Configure network mapping</h2>

<p>This tutorial describes the simplest path to deploy Azure Site Recovery in a test environment. If you do want to configure network mapping as part of this tutorial, read <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=324817">Prepare for network mapping</a> in the Planning Guide. To configure mapping follow the steps to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402534">Configure network mapping</a> in the deployment guide.</p>

<h2><a id="storagemapping"></a>Step 7: Configure storage mapping</h2>

<p>This tutorial describes the simplest path to deploy Azure Site Recovery in a test environment. If you do want to configure storage mapping as part of this tutorial, follow the steps to <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402535">Configure storage mapping</a> in the deployment guide.</p>


<h2><a id="enablevirtual"></a>Step 8: Enable virtual machine protection</h2>
<p>After servers, clouds, and networks are configured correctly, you can enable protection for virtual machines in the cloud.</p>
<OL>
<li>On the <b>Virtual Machines</b> tab in the cloud in which the virtual machine is located, click <b>Enable protection</b> and then select <b>Add virtual machines</b>. </li>
<li>From the list of virtual machines in the cloud, select the one you want to protect.</li> 
</OL>

![Enable virtual machine protection](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_EnableProtectionVM.png)


<P>After protection is enabled two jobs are created. The Enable Protection job runs. Then after the initial replication is completed the Finalize Protection job runs. The virtual machine is only ready for failover after these jobs have finished successfully. You can monitor progress on the <b>Jobs</b> tab.</p>

![Virtual machine protection job](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMJobs.png)


<h2><a id="recoveryplans"></a>Step 7: Configure and run a recovery plan</h2>
A recovery plan gathers virtual machines into groups so that they can fail over as a single unit. To create a recovery plan, do the following: 

1. On the <b>Recovery Plans</b> tab, click <b>Create</b>.
2. On the Specify the Recovery Page Name and Target page, select the source VMM server and  Azure as the target. 

	![Create Recovery Plan](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_RecoveryPlan1.png)

3. On the Select Virtual Machines page, select virtual machines to add to the recovery plan.  Only virtual machines with protection enabled are shown. The virtual machines are added to the recovery plan in default group (Group 1).
4. Click the check mark to create the recovery plan. 

	![Recovery Plan VMs](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_RecoveryPlan2.png)


<h3><a id="run"></a>Test a failover</h3>
<p>Recovery plans can run as part of a proactive test or planned failover, or during an unplanned failover. This walkthrough describes how to run a test failover to verify that your  failover strategy is working as expected. Test failover simulates your failover and recovery mechanism in an isolated network. Note the following:

<UL>
<li>When a test failover is triggered, you are requested to specify how test virtual machines should be connected to networks after the failover. </li>
<LI>If you want to use an existing network we recommend that you create a separate logical network  that is not used in production for this purpose.</LI>
<LI>If you select the option to automatically create a test VM network, the temporary networks and test virtual machines are cleaned up automatically after the test failover is complete.</LI>
<LI>If you are using a virtual LAN (VLAN) based logical network, ensure that the network sites you add to the logical network are isolated. </LI>
<LI>If you are using a Windows Network Virtualization-based logical network, Azure Site Recovery will automatically create isolated VM networks.</LI>
</UL>


<h5><a id="runtest"></a>Run the failover</h5>
Run a test failover for a recovery plan as follows:

<OL>
<LI>On the <b>Recovery Plans</b> tab, select the required recovery plan.</LI>
<LI>To initiate the failover, click the <b>Test Failover</b> button.</LI>
<LI>On the Confirm Test Failover page, specify how virtual machines should be connected to networks after the test failover, as follows:</LI>
<UL>
<LI><b>None</b>—Select this setting to specify that VM networks should not be used in the test failover. Use this option if you want to test individual virtual machines rather than your network configuration. It also provides a quick glance of how test failover functionality works. Test virtual machines will not be connected to networks after a failover.</LI>
<LI><b>Use existing</b>—Use this option if you have already created and isolated a VM network to use for test failover. After the failover all test virtual machines used in the test failover will be connected to the network specified in <b>VM Network</b>.</LI>
<LI><b>Create automatically</b>—Select this setting to specify that Azure Site Recovery should automatically create a VM network based on the setting you specify in Logical Network, and its related network sites. Use this option if the recovery plan uses more than one VM network. In the case of Windows Network Virtualization networks, this option can be used to automatically create VM networks with the same settings (subnets and IP address pools) of those in the network of the replica virtual machine. These VM networks are cleaned up automatically after the test failover is complete.</LI>
</UL>
</OL>


<P>On the Confirm Test Failover page, details of the VMM server on which the test virtual machines will be created are displayed. You can follow the progress of test failover jobs on the <b>Jobs</b> tab. After the test failover is complete, do the following:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Verify that the virtual machines start successfully.</LI>
<LI>After verifying that virtual machines start successfully, complete the test failover to clean up the isolated environment. If you selected to automatically create VM networks, clean up deletes all the test virtual machines and test networks.</LI>
<LI>Click <b>Notes</b> to record and save any observations associated with the test failover.</LI>
<LI>In addition to details on the <b>Jobs</b> tab, when you run a test failover for a recovery plan the  process is displayed on the recovery plan details page. You can view failover steps and status, and view or create notes for the test failover.</LI>
<li>You can export a job in the failover list into an Excel spreadsheet.</li>
</OL>

<h4><a id="runtest"></a>Monitor activity</h5>
<p>You can use the <b>Jobs</b> tab and <b>Dashboard</b> to view and monitor the main jobs performed by the Azure Site Recovery vault, including configuring protection for a cloud, enabling and disabling protection for a virtual machine, running a failover (planned, unplanned, or test), and committing an unplanned failover.</p>

<p>From the <b>Jobs</b> tab you view jobs, drill down into job details and errors, run job queries to retrieve jobs that match specific criteria, export jobs to Excel, and restart failed jobs.</p>

<p>From the <b>Dashboard</b> you can download the latest versions of Provider and Agent installation files, get configuration information for the vault, see the number of virtual machines that have protection managed by the vault, see recent jobs, manage the vault certificate, and resynchronize virtual machines.</p>

<p>For more information about interacting with jobs and the dashboard, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398534">Operations and Monitoring Guide</a>.</p>
