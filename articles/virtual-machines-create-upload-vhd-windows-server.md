#Create and upload a Windows Server VHD to Azure#

A virtual machine in Microsoft Azure runs the operating system that you choose when you create the virtual machine. Microsoft Azure stores a virtual machine's operating system in a virtual hard disk in VHD format (a .vhd file). A VHD of an operating system that has been prepared for duplication is called an image. This article shows you how to create your own image by uploading a .vhd file with an operating system you've installed and generalized. For more information about disks and images in Microsoft Azure, see [Manage Disks and Images](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj672979.aspx).

**Note**: When you create a virtual machine, you can customize the operating system settings to facilitate running your application. The configuration that you set is stored on disk for that virtual machine. For instructions, see [How to Create a Custom Virtual Machine](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial/).

##Prerequisites##
This article assumes that you have the following items:

**An Azure subscription** - If you don't have one, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see [Create an Azure account](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/php/tutorials/create-a-windows-azure-account/).  

**Microsoft Azure PowerShell** - You have the Microsoft Azure PowerShell module installed. To download the module, see [Microsoft Azure Downloads](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/downloads/). A tutorial to install and configure PowerShell with your Azure Subscription can be found [here](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/install-configure-powershell/).

- The [Add-AzureVHD](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/dn205185.aspx) cmdlet, which is part of the Microsoft Azure PowerShell module. You'll use this cmdlet to upload the VHD.

**A supported Windows operating system stored in a .vhd file** - You have installed a supported Windows Server operating system to a virtual hard disk. Multiple tools exist to create .vhd files. You can use a virtualization solutions such as Hyper-V to create the .vhd file and install the operating system. For instructions, see [Install the Hyper-V Role and Configure a Virtual Machine](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh846766.aspx).

**Important**: The VHDX format is not supported in Microsoft Azure. You can convert the disk to VHD format using Hyper-V Manager or the [Convert-VHD cmdlet](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh848454.aspx). A tutorial on this can be found [here](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2012/10/03/using-powershell-to-convert-a-vhd-to-a-vhdx.aspx).
 
**Window Server operating system media.** This task requires an .iso file that contains the Windows Server operating system. The following Windows Server versions are supported:

This task includes the following steps:

- [Step 1: Prepare the image to be uploaded] []
- [Step 2: Create a storage account in Azure] []
- [Step 3: Prepare the connection to Azure] []
- [Step 4: Upload the .vhd file] []

## <a id="prepimage"> </a>Step 1: Prepare the image to be uploaded ##


Before the image can be uploaded to Azure, it must be generalized by using the Sysprep command. For more information about using Sysprep, see [How to Use Sysprep: An Introduction](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb457073.aspx).

In the virtual machine that you just created, complete the following procedure:

1. Log in to the operating system.

2. Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator. Change the directory to **%windir%\system32\sysprep**, and then run `sysprep.exe`.

	![Open Command Prompt window](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/sysprep_commandprompt.png)

3.	The **System Preparation Tool** dialog box appears.

	![Start Sysprep](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/sysprepgeneral.png)

4.  In the **System Preparation Tool**, select **Enter System Out of Box Experience (OOBE)** and make sure that Generalize is checked.

5.  In **Shutdown Options**, select **Shutdown**.

6.  Click **OK**. 




## <a id="createstorage"> </a>Step 2: Create a storage account in Azure ##

A storage account represents the highest level of the namespace for accessing the storage services and is associated with your Azure subscription. You need a storage account in Azure to upload a .vhd file to Azure that can be used for creating a virtual machine. You can use the Azure Management Portal to create a storage account.

1. Sign in to the Azure Management Portal.

2. On the command bar, click **New**.

3. Click **Storage Account**, and then click **Quick Create**.

	![Quick create a storage account](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Storage-quick-create.png)

4. Fill out the fields as follows:

	
	
- Under **URL**, type a subdomain name to use in the URL for the storage account. The entry can contain from 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers. This name becomes the host name within the URL that is used to address Blob, Queue, or Table resources for the subscription.
			
- Choose the **location or affinity group** for the storage account. By specifying an affinity group, you can co-locate your cloud services in the same data center with your storage.
		 
- Decide whether to use **geo-replication** for the storage account. Geo-replication is turned on by default. This option replicates your data to a secondary location, at no cost to you, so that your storage fails over to a secondary location if a major failure occurs that can't be handled in the primary location. The secondary location is assigned automatically, and can't be changed. If legal requirements or organizational policy requires tighter control over the location of your cloud-based storage, you can turn off geo-replication. However, be aware that if you later turn on geo-replication, you will be charged a one-time data transfer fee to replicate your existing data to the secondary location. Storage services without geo-replication are offered at a discount. More details on managing geo-replication of Storage accounts can be found here: [How To Manage Storage Accounts](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-manage-storage-account/).

	![Enter storage account details](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Storage-create-account.png)

5. Click **Create Storage Account**.

	The account now appears under **Storage Accounts**.

	![Storage account successfully created](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Storagenewaccount.png)

6. Next, create a container for your uploaded VHDs. Click on the **Storage account name** and then click on **Containers**.

	![Storage account detail](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/storageaccount_detail.png)

7. Click **Create a Container**.

	![Storage account detail](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/storageaccount_container.png)

8. Type a **Name** for your container and select the **Access Policy**.

	![Container name](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/storageaccount_containervalues.png)

	> [WACOM.NOTE] By default, the container is private and can be accessed only by the account owner. To allow public read access to the blobs in the container, but not the container properties and metadata, use the "Public Blob" option. To allow full public read access for the container and blobs, use the "Public Container" option.

## <a id="PrepAzure"> </a>Step 3: Prepare the connection to Microsoft Azure ##

Before you can upload a .vhd file, you need to establish a secure connection between your computer and your subscription in Microsoft Azure. You can use the Microsoft Azure Active Directory or the certificate method for doing this.

<h3>Use the Microsoft Azure AD method</h3>

1. Open the Microsoft Azure PowerShell console, as instructed in [How to: Install Microsoft Azure PowerShell](#Install).

2. Type the following command:    `Add-AzureAccount`. A window opens up where you can sign into Azure with your Microsoft account.

	![PowerShell Window](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/add_azureaccount.png)

3. Microsoft Azure authenticates and saves the credential information, and then closes the window.

<h3>Use the certificate method</h3> 

1. Open a Microsoft Azure PowerShell window. 

2.	Type: 
	`Get-AzurePublishSettingsFile`.


3. A browser window opens and prompts you to download a .publishsettings file. It contains information and a certificate for your Microsoft Azure subscription.

	![Browser download page](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Browser_download_GetPublishSettingsFile.png)

3. Save the .publishsettings file. 

4. Type: 
	`Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile <PathToFile>`

	Where `<PathToFile>` is the full path to the .publishsettings file. 


	For more information, see [Get Started with Microsoft Azure Cmdlets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj554332.aspx) 
	
	For more information on installing and configuring PowerShell, see [How to install and configure Microsoft Azure PowerShell](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/install-configure-powershell/) 


## <a id="upload"> </a>Step 4: Upload the .vhd file ##

When you upload the .vhd file, you can place the .vhd file anywhere within your blob storage. In the following command examples, **BlobStorageURL** is the URL for the storage account that you created in Step 2, **YourImagesFolder** is the container within blob storage where you want to store your images. **VHDName** is the label that appears in the Management Portal to identify the virtual hard disk. **PathToVHDFile** is the full path and name of the .vhd file. 


1. From the Microsoft Azure PowerShell window you used in the previous step, type:

	`Add-AzureVhd -Destination "<BlobStorageURL>/<YourImagesFolder>/<VHDName>.vhd" -LocalFilePath <PathToVHDFile>`
	
	![PowerShell Add-AzureVHD](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/powershell_upload_vhd.png)

	For more information about the Add-AzureVhd cmdlet, see [Add-AzureVhd](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn495173.aspx).

##Add the Image to Your List of Custom Images ##
After you upload the .vhd, you add it as an image to the list of custom images associated with your subscription.

1. From the Management Portal, under **All Items**, click **Virtual Machines**.

2. Under Virtual Machines, click **Images**.

3. And then click **Create an Image**.

	![PowerShell Add-AzureVHD](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Create_Image.png)

4. In **Create an image from a VHD**, do the following:
 	
	- Specify **name**
	- Specify **description**
	- To specify the **URL of your VHD** click the folder button to launch the below dialog box
 
	![Select VHD](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Select_VHD.png)
	- Select the storage account your VHD is in and click **Open**. This returns you to the **Create an image from a VHD** window.
	- After you return to the **Create an image from a VHD** window, select the Operating System Family.
	- Check **I have run Sysprep on the virtual machine associated with this VHD** to acknowledge that you generalized the operating system in Step 1, and then click **OK**. 

	![Add Image](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/Create_Image_From_VHD.png)

5. **OPTIONAL :** You can also use Azure PowerShell's Add-AzureVMImage cmdlet to add your VHD as an image.

	From the Microsoft Azure PowerShell window, type:

	`Add-AzureVMImage -ImageName <Your Image's Name> -MediaLocation <location of the VHD> -OS <Type of the OS on the VHD>`
	
	![PowerShell Add-AzureVMImage](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/add_azureimage_powershell.png)

6. After you complete the previous steps, the new image is listed when you choose the **Images** tab. 


	![custom image](./media/virtual-machines-create-upload-vhd-windows-server/vm_custom_image.png)

	When you create a new virtual machine, you can now use this new image. Choose **My Images** to show the new image. For instructions, see [Create a Virtual Machine Running Windows Server](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-windows-tutorial/).
