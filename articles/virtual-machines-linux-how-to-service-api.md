#How to Use the Service Management API

##Initialization##

To invoke the Azure IaaS service management API from NodeJS, the `azure` module is used.

	var azure = require('azure');

First create an instance of the ServiceManagementService. All calls to the API will use this object. The subscription id, credentials, and other connection options are established at this time. To manage more than one subscription, create more than one ServiceManagementService.

	var iaasClient = azure.createServiceManagementService(subscriptionid, auth, options);

- Subscriptionid is a required string. It should be the subscription id of the account being accessed.
- Auth is an optional object that specifies the private key and public certificate to be used with this account.	
	- keyfile - file path of .pem file that has private key. Ignored if keyvalue is specified.
	- keyvalue - actual value of private key as stored in a .pem file.
	- certfile - file path of .pem file that has public certificate. Ignored if cervalue is specified.
	- certvalue - actual value of public certificate as stored in a .pem file.
	- If the above values are not specified, then process environment variable values `CLIENT_AUTH_KEYFILE` and `CLIENT_AUTH_CERTFILE` are read and used. If these are not set, then default values for the files are tried: priv.pem and pub.pem.
	- If it is not possible to load the private key and public certificate, then an error is thrown.

- Options is an optional object that may be used to control properties used by the client.	
	- host - host name of Azure management server. If not specified, it uses the default host.
	- apiversion - version string to use in the HTTP header. If not specified uses default version.
	- serializetype - may be XML or JSON. If not specified uses default serialization.

Optionally a tunneling proxy may be used to enable the HTTPS request to go through a proxy. When the IaasClient is created it will process the environment variable `HTTPS_PROXY`. If it is set to a valid URL, then the host name and port are parsed from the URL and are used in subsequent requests to identify the proxy.

		iaasClient.SetProxyUrl(proxyurl)

The SetProxyUrl may be called to explicitly set the proxy host and port. It has the same effect as setting the `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable, and will override the environment setting.

##Callbacks##

All the APIs have a required callback argument. Completion of the request is signaled by calling the function passed in the callback. 

	callback(rsp)

- The callback has a single parameter which is the response object.
- isSuccessful - true or false
- statusCode - HTTP Status code from the response
- response - the response parsed into a javascript object. Set if isSuccessful is true.
- error - a javascript object holding error information set if isSuccessful is false.
- body - the actual body of the response as a string
- headers - the actual HTTP headers of the response
- reqopts - the Node HTTP request options used to make the request.

Note that in some cases completion may only indicate that the request was accepted. In this case use **GetOperationStatus** to get the final status.

##APIs##

**iaasClient.GetOperationStatus(requested, callback)**

##Sample code##

Here is a sample javascript code that creates a hosted service and a deployment, and then polls for the completion status of the deployment.

	  keyfile : '../certs/priv.pem',
