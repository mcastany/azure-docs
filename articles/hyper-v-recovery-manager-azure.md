# Getting Started with Azure Site Recovery: On-Premises to Azure Protection



<div class="dev-callout"> 

<p>Use Azure Site Recovery to protect virtual machines that run on Hyper-V hosts located in System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) clouds. You can configure:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>On-premises to Azure protection</b>—Replicate on-premise virtual machines located on Hyper-V host servers in VMM clouds to Azure. You configure and enable protection settings in Azure Site Recovery vaults. Virtual machine data is replicated from the on-premises Hyper-V server to Azure storage.</li>

<li><b>On-premises to on-premises protection</b>—Replicate virtual machines located on Hyper-V host servers in VMM clouds from one on-premises site to another. You configure and enable protection settings in Azure Site Recovery vaults. Virtual machine data is replicated from one on-premises Hyper-V server to another. Azure Site Recovery simply orchestrates the process.

Click  <b>Next</b> to use the default Internet connection settings configured on the server![Recovery Services Agent location](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_AgentInstallSettings.png)


<h2><a id="clouds"></a>Step 6: Configure cloud protection settings</h2>

After VMM servers are registered, you can configure cloud protection settings. You enabled the option **Synchronize cloud data with the vault** when you installed the Provider so all clouds on the VMM server will appear in the <b>Protected Items</b> tab in the vault.


![Published Cloud](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_Clouds.png)


Configure protection settings as follows:


1. On the Quick Start page, click **Set up protection for VMM clouds**.

![Enable cloud protection](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_EnableCloudProtection.png)

2. On the **Protected Items** tab, click on the cloud you want to configure and go to the **Configuration** tab.
3. In <b>Target</b>, select <b>Microsoft Azure</b>.
4. In <b>Storage Account</b>, select the Azure storage you want to use to store Azure virtual machines.
5. Set <b>Encrypt stored data</b> to <b>Off</b>. This setting specifies that data should be encrypted replicated between the on-premises site and Azure.
6. In <b>Copy frequency</b> leave the default setting. This value specifies how frequently data should be synchronized between source and target locations.  
7. In <b>Retain recovery points for</b>, leave the default setting. With a default value of zero only the latest recovery point for a primary virtual machine is stored on a replica host server. 
8. In <b>Frequency of application-consistent snapshots</b>, leave the default setting. This value specifies how often to create snapshots. Snapshots use Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) to ensure that applications are in a consistent state when the snapshot is taken.  If you do set a value, make sure it's less than the number of additional recovery points you configure.

	![Cloud Configuration](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_CloudConfigureE2A1.png)

9. In <b>Replication start time</b>, specify when initial replication of data to Azure should start. The timezone on the Hyper-V host server will be used. We recommend that you schedule the initial replication during off-peak hours. 

	![Cloud replication settings](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_PublishCloudSetup2.png)

<p>After you save the settings a job will be created and can be monitored on the <b>Jobs</b> tab. All Hyper-V host servers in the VMM source cloud will be configured for replication.

After saving, cloud settings can be modified on the <b>Configure</b> tab. To modify the target location or target storage you'll need to remove the cloud configuration, and then reconfigure the cloud. Note that if you change the storage account the change is only applied for virtual machines that are enabled for protection after the storage account has been modified. Existing virtual machines are not migrated to the new storage account.</p>

<h2><a id="networkmapping"></a>Step 7: Configure network mapping</h2>

<p>You can optionally enable network mapping to map source VM networks to target Azure virtual networks. If you don’t create network mappings then only virtual machines that fail over in the same recovery plan can connect to each other in Azure. If you create a network mapping then all virtual machines that fail over on the same network can connect to each other, irrespective of which recovery plan they belong to. In addition if a network gateway is setup on the target Azure network then virtual machines can connect to on-premises virtual machines. If you want to configure network mapping as part of this tutorial, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402533">Configure network mapping</a> in the deployment guide.</p>




<h2><a id="virtualmachines"></a>Step 8: Enable protection for virtual machines</h2>

<p>After servers, clouds, and networks are configured correctly, you can enable protection for virtual machines in the cloud. </p>



<p> Before you enable protection for a virtual machine verify and update its settings if required. For example the guest operating system on the virtual machine must be Windows Server 2008 or later, or Linux. The virtual machine must be generation 1 only. For a full list of Azure Site Recovery requirements, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402602">Prerequisites and support</a> in the Planning guide.</p>

<p>In the VMM console check and update settings. You modify operating system settings for the virtual machine in the General page of the virtual machine properties. You update the operating system disk settings in the Hardware Configuration page.</p>

![Modify virtual machine properties](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMMVMPropsGeneral.png)

![Modify virtual machine properties](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMMVMPropsHW.png)

<OL>
<li>To enable protection, on the <b>Virtual Machines</b> tab in the cloud in which the virtual machine is located, click <b>Enable protection</b> and then select <b>Add virtual machines</b>. </li>
<li>From the list of virtual machines in the cloud, select the one you want to protect.</li> 
</OL>

![Enable virtual machine protection](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_EnableProtectionVM.png)


<P>After protection is enabled two jobs are created. The Enable Protection job runs. Then after the initial replication is completed the Finalize Protection job runs. The virtual machine is only ready for failover after these jobs have finished successfully. You can monitor progress on the <b>Jobs</b> tab.</p>

![Virtual machine protection job](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMJobs.png)


<h2><a id="recoveryplans"></a>Step 9: Configure and run a recovery plan</h2>
A recovery plan gathers virtual machines into groups so that they can fail over as a single unit. To create a recovery plan, do the following: 

1. On the <b>Recovery Plans</b> tab, click <b>Create</b>.
2. On the Specify the Recovery Page Name and Target page, select the source VMM server and  Azure as the target. 

	![Create Recovery Plan](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_RecoveryPlan1.png)

3. On the Select Virtual Machines page, select virtual machines to add to the recovery plan.  Only virtual machines with protection enabled are shown. The virtual machines are added to the recovery plan in default group (Group 1).
4. Click the check mark to create the recovery plan. 

	![Recovery Plan VMs](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_RecoveryPlan2.png)



<h3><a id="run"></a>Test a failover</h3>
Recovery plans can run as part of a proactive test or planned failover, or during an unplanned failover. This walkthrough describes how to run a test failover from VMM to Azure to verify that your  failover strategy is working as expected.  Test failover simulates your failover and recovery mechanism in an isolated network. Note the following:
<UL>
<li>If you want to connect to the virtual machine in Azure using Remote Desktop after the failover, enable Remote Desktop Connection on the virtual machine before you run the test failover.</li>
<li>After failover you'll use a public IP address to connect to the virtual machine in Azure using Remote Desktop. If you want to do this, ensure you don't have any domain policies that prevent you from connecting to a virtual machine using a public address.</li>
</UL>

<h4><a id="runtest"></a>Run the failover</h5>
Run a test failover for a recovery plan as follows:


1. Before you run the recovery plan you can validate the settings of virtual machines in the plan. To do this, on the properties page for the cloud, click the virtual machine. On the Source and Target Properties for Failover page, verify the settings. In particular verify that the suggested size for the target virtual machine in Azure is correct, and that network settings are accurate. For a full list of virtual machine prerequirements, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=402676">Prerequisites and support</a>. 

![Virtual Machine Properties](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_VMPropertiesE2A.png)

2. On the **Recovery Plans** tab, select the required recovery plan.
3. To initiate the failover, click the **Test Failover** button.
4. On the Confirm Test Failover page, select the Azure network to which your virtual machines will be connected after failover. Optionally you can select <b>No Network</b>. With this setting selected the virtual machines won't be connected to a network after failover.


![Test Failover](./media/hyper-v-recovery-manager-configure-vault/SR_TestFailover.png)

You can follow the progress of test failover jobs on the <b>Jobs</b> tab. After the test failover is complete, do the following:

1. Verify that the virtual machines start successfully in Azure.
2. Click **Notes** to record and save any observations associated with the test failover.
3. In addition to details on the **Jobs** tab, when you run a test failover for a recovery plan the  process is displayed on the recovery plan details page. You can view failover steps and status, and view or create notes for the test failover.  

<h4><a id="runtest"></a>Monitor activity</h5>
<p>You can use the <b>Jobs</b> tab and <b>Dashboard</b> to view and monitor the main jobs performed by the Azure Site Recovery vault, including configuring protection for a cloud, enabling and disabling protection for a virtual machine, running a failover (planned, unplanned, or test), and committing an unplanned failover.</p>

<p>From the <b>Jobs</b> tab you view jobs, drill down into job details and errors, run job queries to retrieve jobs that match specific criteria, export jobs to Excel, and restart failed jobs.</p>

<p>From the <b>Dashboard</b> you can download the latest versions of Provider and Agent installation files, get configuration information for the vault, see the number of virtual machines that have protection managed by the vault, see recent jobs, manage the vault certificate, and resynchronize virtual machines.</p>

<p>For more information about interacting with jobs and the dashboard, see the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398534">Operations and Monitoring Guide</a>.</p>
