# Getting Started with the AzCopy Command-Line Utility

AzCopy is a command-line utility designed for high-performance uploading, downloading, and copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blob and File storage. This guide provides an overview for using AzCopy.

> [WACOM.NOTE] This guide assumes that you have installed AzCopy 2.5 or later. Note that AzCopy is in pre-release, so command-line options and their functions may change in future releases.

##<a id="install"></a> Download and install AzCopy

1. Download the [latest version of AzCopy](http://aka.ms/downloadazcopy).
2. Run the installation. By default, the AzCopy installation creates a folder named `AzCopy` under `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\` (on a machine running 64-bit Windows) or `%ProgramFiles%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\` (on a machine running 32-bit Windows). However, you can change the installation path from the setup wizard.
3. If desired, you can add the AzCopy installation location to your system path.

##<a id="syntax"></a> Understand the AzCopy command-line syntax

Next, open a command window, and navigate to the AzCopy installation directory on your computer, where the `AzCopy.exe` executable is located. The basic syntax for AzCopy commands is:

	AzCopy <source> <destination> [filepattern] [options]

- The `<source>` parameter specifies the source data from which to copy. The source can be a file system directory, a blob container, a blob virtual directory, or a storage file share.

- The `<destination>` parameter specifies the destination to copy to. The destination can be a file system directory, a blob container, a blob virtual directory, or a storage file share.

- The behavior of the optional `filepattern` parameter is determined by the location of the source data, and the presence of the recursive mode option. Recursive mode is specified via option `/S`. 
	
	If the specified source is a directory in the file system, then standard wildcards are in effect, and the file pattern provided is matched against files within the directory. If option `/S` is specified, then AzCopy also matches the specified pattern against all files in any subfolders beneath the directory.
	
	If the specified source is a blob container or virtual directory, then wildcards are not applied. If option `/S` is specified, then AzCopy interprets the specified file pattern as a blob prefix. If option `/S` is not specified, then AzCopy matches the file pattern against exact blob names.
	
	If the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (*e.g.* `abc.txt`) to copy a single file, or specify option `/S` to copy all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option `/S` together will result in an error.
	
	The default file pattern used when no file pattern is specified is `*.*` for a file system directory, or an empty prefix for an Azure Blob or File storage resource.

	> [WACOM.NOTE] Due to performance considerations, AzCopy version 2.5 no longer supports multiple file patterns in a single command. You must now issue multiple commands, each with a single file pattern, to address the scenario of multiple file patterns.

- The available options for the `options` parameter are described in the table below. You can also type `AzCopy /?` from the command line for help with options.

##<a id="limit-writes"></a> Limit concurrent writes while copying data

When you copy blobs or files with AzCopy, keep in mind that another application may be modifying the data while you are copying it. If possible, ensure that the data you are copying is not being modified during the copy operation. For example, when copying a VHD associated with an Azure virtual machine, make sure that no other applications are currently writing to the VHD. Alternately, you can create a snapshot of the VHD first and then copy the snapshot.

If you cannot prevent other applications from writing to blobs or files while they are being copied, then keep in mind that by the time the job finishes, the copied resources may no longer have full parity with the source resources.

##<a id="copy-blobs"></a> Copy Azure blobs with AzCopy

The examples below demonstrate a variety of scenarios for copying blobs with AzCopy.

### Copy a single blob

**Upload a file from the file system to Blob storage:**
	
	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key abc.txt

**Download a blob from Blob storage to the file system:**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key abc.txt

### Copy a blob via server-side copy

When you copy a blob within a storage account or across storage accounts, a server-side copy operation is performed. For more information about server-side copy operations, see [Introducing Asynchronous Cross-Account Copy Blob](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx).

**Copy a blob within a storage account:**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mycontainer1 https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /sourcekey:key /destkey:key abc.txt 

**Copy a blob across storage accounts:**

	AzCopy https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mycontainer1 https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /sourcekey:key1 /destkey:key2 abc.txt
 
### Copy a blob from the secondary region 

If your storage account has read-access geo-redundant storage enabled, then you can copy data from the secondary region. 

**Copy a blob to the primary account from the secondary:**

	AzCopy https://myaccount1-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer1 https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer2 /sourcekey:key1 /destkey:key2 abc.txt

**Download a blob in the secondary to a file in the file system:**

	AzCopy https://myaccount-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key abc.txt

### Upload a file to a new blob container or virtual directory

**Upload a file to a new blob container**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer /destkey:key abc.txt

Note that if the specified destination container does not exist, AzCopy will create it and upload the file into it.

**Upload a file to a new blob virtual directory**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/vd /destkey:key abc.txt

Note that if the specified virtual directory does not exist, AzCopy will upload the file to include the virtual directory in its name (*e.g.*, `vd/abc.txt` in the example above).

### Download a blob to a new folder

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key abc.txt

If the folder `C:\myfolder` does not yet exist, AzCopy will create it in the file system and download `abc.txt ` into the new folder.

### Upload files and subfolders in a directory to a container, recursively

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key /S

Specifying option `/S` copies the contents of the specified directory to Blob storage recursively, meaning that all subfolders and their files will be copied as well. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    subfolder\a.txt
    subfolder\abcd.txt

### Upload files from a directory to a container, non-recursively

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key

If you do not specify option `/S` on the command line, AzCopy will not copy recursively. Only the files in the specified directory are copied; any subfolders and their files are NOT copied. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt

### Download all blobs in a container to a directory in the file system, recursively

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:  

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the directory `C:\myfolder` will include the following files:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\vd1\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\vd1\abcd.txt

### Download blobs in a virtual blob directory to a directory in the file system, recursively

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/vd1/ C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the directory `C:\myfolder` will include the following files. Note that only the blobs in the virtual directory are copied:

	C:\myfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\abcd.txt

### Upload files matching the specified file pattern to a container, recursively 

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key a* /S

Assume the following files reside in folder `C:\myfolder`:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt
	C:\myfolder\xyz.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\a.txt
	C:\myfolder\subfolder\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the container will include the following files:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	subfolder\a.txt
	subfolder\abcd.txt
	
### Download blobs with the specified prefix to the file system, recursively

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key a /S

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container. All blobs beginning with the prefix `a` will be copied:

	abc.txt
	abc1.txt
	abc2.txt
	xyz.txt
	vd1\a.txt
	vd1\abcd.txt

After the copy operation, the folder `C:\myfolder` will include the following files:

	C:\myfolder\abc.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc1.txt
	C:\myfolder\abc2.txt

Note that the prefix applies to the virtual directory, which forms the first part of the blob name. In the example shown above, the virtual directory does not match the specified prefix, so it is not copied.


### Copy a blob and its snapshots to another storage account

	AzCopy https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/mycontainer1 https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /sourcekey:key1 /destkey:key2 abc.txt /snapshot

After the copy operation, the target container will include the blob and its snapshots. Assuming the blob in the example above has two snapshots, the container will include the following blob and snapshots:

	abc.txt
	abc (2013-02-25 080757).txt
	abc (2014-02-21 150331).txt


### Use a response file to specify command-line parameters

	AzCopy /@:"C:\myfolder\abc.txt"

You can include any AzCopy command-line parameters in a response file. AzCopy processes the parameters in the file as if they had been specified on the command line, performing a direct substitution with the contents of the file.

**Specify one or more single-line response files**

Assume a response file named `source.txt` that specifies a source container:

	http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer

And a response file named `dest.txt` that specifies a destination folder in the file system:

	C:\myfolder

And a response file named `options.txt` that specifies options for AzCopy:

	/S /Y

To call AzCopy with these response files, all of which reside in a directory `C:\responsefiles`, use this command:

	AzCopy /@:"C:\responsefiles\source.txt" /@:"C:\responsefiles\dest.txt" /sourcekey:[sourcekey] /@:"C:\responsefiles\options.txt"   

AzCopy processes this command just as it would if you included all of the individual parameters on the command line:

	AzCopy http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:[sourcekey] /S /Y

**Specify a multi-line response file**

Assume a response file named `copyoperation.txt`, that contains the following lines. Each AzCopy parameter is specified on its own line:

	http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
 	C:\myfolder
	/sourcekey:[sourcekey]
	/S 
	/Y

To call AzCopy with this response files, use this command:

	AzCopy /@:"C:\responsefiles\copyoperation.txt"

AzCopy processes this command just as it would if you included all of the individual parameters on the command line:	

	AzCopy http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:[sourcekey] /S /Y

Note that each AzCopy parameter must be specified all on one line. For example, AzCopy will fail if you split the parameter across two lines, as shown here for the `/sourcekey` parameter:

	http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
 	C:\myfolder
	/sourcekey:
	[sourcekey]
	/S 
	/Y

### Specify a shared access signature (SAS)
	
**Specify a SAS for the source container using the /sourceSAS option**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 C:\myfolder /sourceSAS:SAS /S

**Specify a SAS for the source container on the source container URI**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?SourceSASToken C:\myfolder /S

**Specify a SAS for the destination container using the /destSAS option**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 /destSAS:SAS abc.txt

**Specify a SAS for the source and destination containers**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 /sourceSAS:SAS1 /destSAS:SAS2 abc.txt


### Specify a journal file folder

Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.

If the journal file does exist, AzCopy will check whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, you will be prompted to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation. 

**Use the default location for the journal file**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key /Z

If you omit option `/Z`, or specify option `/Z` without the folder path, as shown above, AzCopy creates the journal file in the default location, which is `%SystemDrive%\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`. If the journal file already exists, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file. 

**Specify a custom location for the journal file**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key /Z:C:\journalfolder\

This example creates the journal file if it does not already exist. If it does exist, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

**Resume an AzCopy operation**

	AzCopy /Z:C:\journalfolder\

This example resumes the last operation, which may have failed to complete.


### Generate a log file

**Write to the verbose log file in the default location**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key /V

If you specify option `/V` without providing a file path to the verbose log, then AzCopy creates the log file in the default location, which is `%SystemDrive%\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`.

**Write to the verbose log file in a custom location**

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer /destkey:key /V:C:\myfolder\azcopy1.log

Note that if you specify a relative path following option `/V`, such as `/V:test/azcopy1.log`, then the verbose log is created in the current working directory within a subfolder named `test`.


### Set the last-modified time of downloaded files to be same as the source blobs

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key /MT


### Exclude blobs from the copy operation based on their last-modified time

Specify the `/MT` option to compare the last-modified time of the source blob and the destination file.

**Exclude blobs that are newer than the destination file**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key /MT /XN

**Exclude blobs that are older than the destination file**

	AzCopy https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer C:\myfolder /sourcekey:key /MT /XO

### Specify the number of concurrent operations to start

Option `/NC` specifies the number of concurrent copy operations. By default, AzCopy will begin concurrent operations at eight times the number of core processors you have. If you are running AzCopy across a low-bandwidth network, you can specify a lower number for this option to avoid failure caused by resource competition.


###	Run AzCopy against blob resources in the storage emulator

	AzCopy https://127.0.0.1:10004/myaccount/myfileshare/ C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /SourceType:Blob /S


##<a id="copy-files"></a> Copy files in an Azure file share with AzCopy

The examples below demonstrate a variety of scenarios for copying Azure files with AzCopy.

### Download a file from an Azure file share to the file system

	AzCopy https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/myfolder1/ C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key abc.txt

Note that if the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (*e.g.* `abc.txt`) to copy a single file, or specify option `/S` to copy all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option `/S` together will result in an error.

### Download files and folders in an Azure file share to the file system, recursively

	AzCopy https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ C:\myfolder /SourceKey:key /S

Note that any empty folders will not be copied.


### Upload files and folders from the file system to an Azure file share, recursively

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /DestKey:key /S

Note that any empty folders will not be copied.


### Upload files matching the specified file pattern to an Azure file share, recursively

	AzCopy C:\myfolder https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ /DestKey:key ab* /S
