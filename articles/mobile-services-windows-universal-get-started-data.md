This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to leverage data in a universal Windows 8.1 app. In this tutorial, you will download a Visual Studio project for a universal Windows app that stores data in memory, create a new mobile service, integrate the mobile service with the app, and then log in to the Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

>[WACOM.NOTE]This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013 Update 2, which .

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Download the Windows Store app project][Get the Windows Store app] 
2. [Create the mobile service from Visual Studio]
3. [Add a data table for storage and update the app]
5. [Test the app against Mobile Services]

>[WACOM.NOTE]To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>. 

##<a name="download-app"></a>Download the GetStartedWithData project

This tutorial is built on the [GetStartedWithMobileServices app][Developer Code Samples site], which is a Windows Store app project in Visual Studio 2013. The UI for this app is identical to the app generated by the Mobile Services quickstart, except that added items are stored locally in memory. 

1. Download the C# version of the GetStartedWithMobileServices sample app from the [Developer Code Samples site]. 

   	![][10]

2. In Visual Studio 2013, open the downloaded project and examine the MainPage.xaml.cs file.

   	Notice that added **TodoItem** objects are stored in an in-memory **ObservableCollection&lt;TodoItem&gt;**.

3. Press the **F5** key to rebuild the project and start the app.

4. In the app, type some text in **Insert a TodoItem**, then click **Save**.

   	![][0]  

   	Notice that the saved text is displayed in the second column under **Query and update data**.

<h2><a name="create-service"></a><span class="short-header">Create the mobile service</span>Create a new mobile service from Visual Studio</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-service-vs2013.md)]

<ol start="7"><li><p>In Solution Explorer, open the App.xaml.cs code file, and notice the new static field that was added to the **App** class, which looks like the following example:</p> 

		<pre><code>public static Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient 
		    todolistClient = new Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices.MobileServiceClient(
		        "https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/",
		        "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX");
		</code></pre>

	<p>This code provides access to your new mobile service in your app by using an instance of the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=302030">MobileServiceClient class</a>. The client is created by supplying the URI and the application key of the new mobile service. This static field is available to all pages in your app.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<h2><a name="add-table"></a><span class="short-header">Add a new table</span>Add a new table to the mobile service and update the app</h2>

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013](../includes/mobile-services-create-new-table-vs2013.md)]

3. In the file MainPage.xaml.cs, add or uncomment the following using statements: 

		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.MobileServices;
		using Newtonsoft.Json;

4. In this same file, replace the TodoItem class definition with the following code: 

		public class TodoItem
		{
		    public string Id { get; set; }
		
		    [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "text")]
		    public string Text { get; set; }
		
		    [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "complete")] 
		    public bool Complete { get; set; }
		}

	The **JsonPropertyAttribute** is used to define the mapping between property names in the client type to column names in the underlying data table.

5. Comment the line that defines the existing items collection, then uncomment or add the following lines and replace _&lt;yourClient&gt;_ with the `MobileServiceClient` field added to the App.xaml.cs file when you connected your project to the mobile service: 

		private MobileServiceCollection<TodoItem, TodoItem> items;
		private IMobileServiceTable<TodoItem> todoTable = 
		    App.<yourClient>.GetTable<TodoItem>();
		  
	This code creates a mobile services-aware binding collection (items) and a proxy class for the database table (todoTable). 

6. In the **InsertTodoItem** method, remove the line of code that sets the **TodoItem.Id** property, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code: 

		await todoTable.InsertAsync(todoItem);


	This code inserts a new item into the table. 

	<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong><p>New tables are created with the Id, __createdAt, __updatedAt, and __version columns. When dynamic schema is enabled, Mobile Services automatically generates new columns based on the JSON object in the insert or update request. For more information, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/jj193175.aspx">Dynamic schema</a>.</p></div>

7. In the **RefreshTodoItems** method, add the **async** modifier to the method, then uncomment the following line of code: 

		items = await todoTable.ToCollectionAsync();

	This sets the binding to the collection of items in `todoTable`, which contains all of the **TodoItem** objects returned from the mobile service. 

8. In the **UpdateCheckedTodoItem** method, add the **async** modifier to the method, and uncomment the following line of code: 

		await todoTable.UpdateAsync(item);

	This sends an item update to the mobile service. 

Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for backend storage, it's time to test the app against Mobile Services.

<h2><a name="test-app"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test the app against your new mobile service</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. As before, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	![][9]
  
   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with id values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

5. In the app, check one of the items in the list, then go back to the Browse tab in the portal and click **Refresh**. 

  	Notice that the complete value has changed from **false** to **true**.

6. In the MainPage.xaml.cs project file, replace the existing **RefreshTodoItems** method with the following code that filters out completed items:

        private async void RefreshTodoItems()
        {                       
            // This query filters out completed TodoItems. 
            items = await todoTable
               .Where(todoItem => todoItem.Complete == false)
               .ToCollectionAsync();

            ListItems.ItemsSource = items;            
        }

7. In the app, check another one of the items in the list and then click the **Refresh** button.

   	Notice that the checked item now disappears from the list. Each refresh results in a round-trip to the mobile service, which now returns filtered data.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial.
